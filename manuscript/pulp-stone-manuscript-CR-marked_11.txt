 Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between pulp stones and various health conditions, and to determine whether the presence of pulp stones can serve as an indicator of underlying health issues.

The study conducted by Mathew et al. (2019) has suggested a possible correlation between the occurrence of pulp stones and diabetes. Marfan syndrome, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissues in the body. As a result, individuals with this condition are prone to connective tissue dysplasia and vascular defects, which can lead to endothelial rupture of the pulp arterioles. This rupture can cause hemorrhage within the pulp and induce mineralization, especially of the ensuing blood clots.

Apart from diabetes and Marfan syndrome, there are other possible links and correlations in terms of systemic diseases. For instance, patients with tumoral calcinosis, dentin dysplasia type II, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, elfin facies syndrome, familial expansile osteolysis, and otodental syndrome have also been found to have a higher incidence of pulp stones. These systemic diseases affect different parts of the body, yet they all seem to share a common denominator of causing the formation of pulp stones.

The overall trend in the literature is that there is a causative link between the existence of pulp stones and systemic illnesses. In fact, Bains et al. (2014) have suggested that the presence of large numbers of pulp stones could be used as an indicator of distinct types of systemic diseases. This means that the occurrence of pulp stones can be an early marker for systemic illnesses, which can help in early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

In conclusion, the formation of pulp stones is not a stand-alone occurrence, but rather a manifestation of underlying systemic diseases. Therefore, it is important for dental practitioners to understand the possible correlations between pulp stones and systemic diseases so that they can provide the right diagnosis and treatment for their patients. Additionally, patients with a higher incidence of pulp stones should also be screened for systemic diseases to ensure early detection and management.

Association with caries and restorative treatment

Pulp stone formation is a phenomenon that has been studied extensively by researchers in the field of dentistry. It refers to the calcification of the pulp tissue in teeth, which can occur due to a variety of factors. One of the most commonly cited causes of pulp stone formation is chronic pulp irritation. This occurs when the pulp tissue in a tooth is exposed to constant trauma or irritation, which can lead to the formation of calcified deposits within the pulp.

Studies have shown that there is a strong causal relationship between chronic pulp irritation and the formation of false pulp stones. False pulp stones are calcified deposits that form within the pulp tissue as a result of trauma or irritation, rather than as a natural part of the tooth's development. Researchers have found that caries and restorations in the hand can be significant sources of chronic pulp irritation, which can trigger the formation of false pulp stones.

One study conducted in Australia and Malaysia focused on first molars among a group of patients.
