 in 1988, specimens from 515 boys and girls aged 12 and 13 were analyzed, and the overall prevalence of pulp stones in the sample was 19.2%, with 18.8% in females and 19.8% in males.

It is worth mentioning that the true prevalence of pulp stones in the general population is likely higher than that detected through radiographic analysis. This is because only pulp stones with a diameter greater than 2 mm are detectable with radiographic analysis, and free pulp stones are also more readily discernible on radiography than embedded and adherent pulp stones.

Clinical implications

Despite the prevalence of pulp stones, it is important to note that they do not cause pain unless they impinge on nerves. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to maintain good oral hygiene practices and regularly visit their dentist for check-ups and cleanings to prevent any dental issues from arising.

Pulp stones are a common occurrence in dental patients and can cause a number of issues during endodontic treatment. While nerves can often cause idiopathic pain, they do not typically lead to any other discomfort beyond the possibility of nerve impingement and idiopathic pain. It's important to note that nerves are not a cause of pulpitis, and therefore do not have clear clinical implications or require treatment.

However, pulp stones can interfere with endodontic treatment and should be removed in cases where the interference is particularly strong. The degree of interference depends on the size and location of the stones. For instance, larger pulp stones in the pulp chamber can cause blockage of the root canal openings and impede the movement of dental instruments through the canal. Pulp stones also cause greater blockage if they are located on a curve in the root canal.

It's important to note that embedded and adherent pulp stones have a greater risk of interfering with root canal treatment than free pulp stones, based on both their location and size. No distinction has been found in the literature regarding the relationship between true and false pulp stones.

Therefore, it's essential that dental professionals take note of the presence and location of pulp stones when treating patients for endodontic issues. While pulp stones may not require treatment in principle, they can cause significant problems during treatment and should be addressed accordingly. It's also important that patients communicate any discomfort or pain they may be experiencing to their dental professional, as this can be an indication of nerve impingement or other issues that may require treatment. Overall, understanding the role of pulp stones in endodontic treatment is a crucial component of providing high-quality dental care.

Canals are a common dental procedure that involves removing the pulp of a tooth due to infection or decay. During this process, pulp stones may be discovered, which are small, round calcifications that form within the pulp chamber of a tooth. While they are not harmful, they can cause pain and discomfort for some patients.

To remove pulp stones, dentists typically use burs and ultrasonic instruments. In some cases, sodium hypochlorite may be used as a synergistic material to dissolve the stones. However, it is believed that sodium hypochlorite is more effective in dissolving false pulp stones than true pulp stones due to differences in composition. Nevertheless, the majority of pulp stones found in practice are false.
