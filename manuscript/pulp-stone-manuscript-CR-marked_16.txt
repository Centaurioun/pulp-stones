Our hypothesis was that there is a statistically significant link between restorative treatment and pulp stones, while also examining potential correlations with age and sex. Previous studies have examined pulp stones in Turkish populations, but have not succeeded in finding a statistically significant link between restorative treatment, age, or sex and the presence of pulp stones. Our study aimed to build on these previous findings and provide more comprehensive data on the prevalence of pulp stones in the Turkish population.

This study falls within the category of research performed on samples obtained from radiographic materials. The use of CBCT systems in dentistry has revolutionized the way we diagnose and treat dental conditions. CBCT systems are a variety of traditional standard computer tomography (CT) systems, but are specifically designed for use in dentistry. They rotate around the patient and capture radiographic data using a cone-shaped X-ray beam, providing detailed 3D images of the teeth and surrounding structures.

The study was retrospective in nature, using a sample of radiographic images obtained from patients over a previous period. By analyzing these images, we were able to identify the prevalence of pulp stones in the Turkish population and explore potential correlations with restorative treatment, age, and sex. Our findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of pulp stones in the Turkish population, and could inform future research on this topic. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the prevalence of pulp stones in the Turkish population and highlights the importance of using advanced imaging techniques like CBCT in dental research.

CBCT is a revolutionary imaging technique that has significantly improved the diagnosis and treatment of dental and maxillofacial conditions. Unlike conventional X-ray imaging, CBCT systems provide three-dimensional images of the patient's oral and maxillofacial regions, including the mouth, jaw, and neck. This imaging technique works by rotating the beam source around the patient and capturing the data using a detector that records the information.

The resulting 3D image is an accurate representation of the patient's teeth, gums, and surrounding structures, including the ears, nose, and throat. This imaging modality offers several advantages over traditional X-ray imaging, such as improved diagnostic accuracy, reduced radiation exposure, and enhanced visualization of anatomical structures.

CBCT systems are widely used in dentistry for various clinical applications, including the diagnosis of dental caries, root canal diagnosis, implant planning, detection of abnormalities and anomalies in teeth, assessment of potential cleft palates, and the diagnosis of dental trauma. The use of CBCT systems in endodontics is particularly beneficial, as it allows for the visualization of anatomical features of the root canal that are not visible with conventional X-ray imaging.

Moreover, CBCT imaging has revolutionized the field of implant dentistry, enabling clinicians to accurately plan and place dental implants with improved accuracy and precision. The 3D images provide valuable information about the quality and quantity of bone, as well as the location of vital structures such as nerves and blood vessels.
