In addition to its clinical applications, CBCT imaging also has research applications, allowing scientists to study the complex anatomy of the oral and maxillofacial regions in greater detail. This imaging modality has the potential to unlock new discoveries and innovations in the field of dentistry and beyond.

In conclusion, CBCT imaging is a game-changing technology that has transformed the way we diagnose and treat dental and maxillofacial conditions. The ability to capture high-quality 3D images of the oral and maxillofacial regions has opened up new possibilities for clinicians and researchers alike, enabling them to improve patient outcomes and advance the field of dentistry.

The use of CBCT scans has become an essential part of modern dental treatment procedures. In this study, the CBCT scans taken between 2014 and 2017 were analyzed to determine the suitability of these scans for use in dental research.

During the scanning process, all patients were required to wear lead aprons and thyroid collars to minimize radiation exposure. They were positioned between the beam source and detector of the CBCT system, and an extension cone paralleling (XCP) bitewing was placed in their mouth. The patient was then asked to bite down on a bite block, and the standard head position was used for scanning. The unit was rotated to obtain multiple images, which were then stored for general archival purposes.

To ensure consistency in the study, certain inclusion and exclusion criteria were set for individuals whose tooth specimens were used. Only individuals over 18 years of age, with teeth that had not undergone any crown restoration or root canal treatment, and with at least one specimen from each tooth type in both the maxilla and mandible were included. Individuals under 18 years of age and those who had undergone any type of crown restoration or root canal treatment were excluded from the study.

The use of CBCT scans in dental research has become increasingly popular due to their high-resolution and accuracy in detecting dental problems. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the use of CBCT scans in dental research and their potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of dental issues.

In conducting any research, it is important to establish clear criteria for inclusion and exclusion of participants. In this study, the criteria were formulated based on existing literature in the field, specifically looking at studies that were similar in nature to the current research. The aim was to ensure that the sample size was representative of the population being studied and that the results obtained were valid and reliable.

To be eligible for inclusion in the study, patients had to be above 18 years of age and of both genders. Prior to collecting any data, permission was obtained from each patient, and written informed consent was obtained to ensure that all ethical considerations were met. Patient confidentiality and data safety were also maintained throughout the study.

To ensure that the data collected was reliable, all patient information was reviewed and verified in accordance with standard data security procedures. Additionally, the study was conducted in compliance with existing protocols and manuals, including the Helsinki Declaration and principles of Good Clinical Practice.
