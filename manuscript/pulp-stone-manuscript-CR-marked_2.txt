 True pulp stones are composed of dentin tissue, whereas false pulp stones are composed of other calcified materials such as cementum or enamel.

Although pulp stones are generally considered harmless, they can sometimes cause complications in dental procedures, such as root canals. Additionally, some studies have suggested that pulp stones may be associated with certain systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Further research is required to fully understand the implications of pulp stones on overall health.

Odontoblasts are an important component of the dental pulp. They are derived from the neural crest cells and are found on the outer surface of the pulp. These cells have a peripheral resemblance to dentin and are responsible for synthesizing the dentin matrix and controlling dentin mineralization. In the coronal portion of the pulp chamber, odontoblast cells were particularly abundant, with a frequency of 45,000-65,000 per mm2. However, they were less frequent in the cervical and middle-root areas.

The concentration of true pulp stones was also the highest in the coronal portion of the pulp chamber, where odontoblastic cells were the most abundant. These true pulp stones were composed of dentin lined with odontoblasts. Interestingly, the confinement of dentin by odontoblasts in terms of true pulp stones is not always done by true odontoblasts but by odontoblast-like cells containing tubules. This highlights the diverse nature of odontoblasts and their ability to adapt to different situations.

The cellular products secreted by odontoblasts may also play a role in the formation of true pulp stones. These products aid in the sticking of odontoblasts to the core of dentin tissue, which is surrounded by a small central cavity of cell remnants. This cavity is generally distinct from the cell remnants found in false pulp stones, as previously described.

It is important to note that true pulp stones are rare and present in a minority of pulp stones. False pulp stones, however, are more common and are composed of calcified tissue that does not contain odontoblasts. False pulp stones can be caused by various factors, including trauma, inflammation, and aging.

The process of mineralization of degenerating pulp tissue is complex and involves not only pulp cells but also other elements, such as blood clots and organic collagen fibers. While true pulp stones are composed only of remnants of dead pulp cells, false pulp stones contain a greater mass and volume of material, including blood clots and organic collagen fibers. These fibers typically surround the core of blood clots and dead pulp cells, creating a complex matrix that is difficult to study.

Recent research has shed new light on the nature of false pulp stones and their relationship to Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS). In a study in which clusters of cells were sampled through intrusions from pre-stone mineralizing organic material transitioning into false pulp stones, an abundance of cells of epithelial origin in the root area was discovered. These cells had a particular resemblance to HERS cells, which are epithelial tissue layers that play an important role in root formation. HERS cells form transient structures during the early stages of root formation and elongation, and their presence in false pulp stones suggests a complex interplay between pulp tissue and the surrounding dental structures.
