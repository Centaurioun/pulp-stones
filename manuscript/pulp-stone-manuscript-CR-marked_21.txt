 The prevalence of pulp stones was highest in maxillary molars (42%), which was significantly higher than the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary incisors (4.7%), mandibular incisors (4.6%), maxillary canines (4.6%), mandibular canines (12.6%), maxillary premolars (4.2%), mandibular premolars (13.2%), and mandibular molars (36%).

Moreover, the prevalence of pulp stones was found to be significantly higher in mandibular molars (36%) as compared to maxillary incisors (4.7%), mandibular incisors (4.6%), maxillary canines (4.6%), mandibular canines (12.6%), maxillary premolars (4.2%), and mandibular premolars (13.2%). The prevalence of pulp stones was also higher in mandibular canines (12.6%) and mandibular premolars (13.2%) as compared to maxillary incisors (4.7%), mandibular incisors (4.6%), and maxillary canines (4.6%).

In conclusion, this study highlights the prevalence of restorative treatment and pulp stones in different age groups and types of teeth. The findings of this study can be used to design preventive and restorative measures to improve dental health.

The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth is an important aspect of dental health research. In this study, the prevalence of pulp stones in various types of teeth was examined. The results showed that the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary molars (14.5%) was higher than in other types of teeth, such as maxillary incisors (4.7%), mandibular incisors (4.6%), and maxillary canines (4.6%). This difference was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the study also looked at the prevalence of restorative treatment in different types of teeth. The results revealed that the prevalence of restorative treatment in maxillary molars (31%) and mandibular molars (27.4%) was significantly higher compared to other types of teeth, such as maxillary incisors (4.8%), mandibular incisors (0.5%), maxillary canines (3.7%), mandibular canines (0.5%), maxillary premolars (9.6%), and mandibular premolars (6.8%) (p < 0.05). The prevalence of restorative treatment in maxillary premolars (9.6%) was also found to be significantly higher compared to other types of teeth, such as maxillary incisors (4.8%), mandibular incisors (0.5%), maxillary canines (3.7%), and mandibular canines (0.5%) (p < 0.05).

Interestingly, the study also found that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between the maxilla and mandible (p > 0.05). However, the prevalence of restorative treatment was significantly higher in the maxilla (11.9%) compared to the mandible (7%).

These findings highlight the importance of regular dental check-ups and proper oral hygiene practices to prevent the development of dental issues such as pulp stones and the need for restorative treatment. Additionally, the results of this study provide valuable information for dental professionals to better understand the prevalence of these issues in different types of teeth and areas of the mouth.

The presence of pulp stones in teeth is a common occurrence that can have significant implications for dental health. Pulp stones are calcified structures that form in the pulp chamber of teeth and can lead to complications such as pulpitis and necrosis. The prevalence of pulp stones can vary depending on a number of factors, including age, gender, and dental treatment history.
