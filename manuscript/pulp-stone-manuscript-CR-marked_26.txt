 The reasons behind this phenomenon remain unclear, and further research is needed to better understand the relationship between aging and pulp stones. Nevertheless, the findings of various studies indicate the need for increased dental care and monitoring for older individuals to prevent the development of pulp stones and other dental problems.

The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth has been a topic of interest for many researchers, as these stones can cause discomfort and even lead to dental problems if left untreated. In a study conducted by Hill and colleagues, they found that the prevalence of pulp stones increased with age, with a prevalence of 14.9% in the 10-to-30 age group, 44.4% in the 31-to-51 age group, and 65.1% in the over 51 age group. While the large variations in prevalence with age groups were observed, the main trend of the prevalence of pulp stones increasing with age was confirmed. This trend was also observed in our study, where we found a 3.2% difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between the 18-to-40 and the over-40 age groups.

In another study conducted by Bernick and Nedelman in 1975, they aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of aging on the pulp. They focused on degenerative processes and mechanisms caused by aging and concluded that while the pulp space decreases in general over time, conditions suitable for the gradual calcification of the pulp tissue also take place over time. However, any kind of damage or trauma has a great facilitating effect on this process, leading to the formation of pulp stones.

Overall, these studies highlight the importance of regular dental check-ups and prompt treatment of any dental problems, as the prevalence of pulp stones increases with age and can result in discomfort and dental complications if left untreated. It is also important to note that while aging is a natural process, taking care of one's dental health can help prevent or delay the onset of dental problems.

Blood clots found in the central core of pulp stones are a significant concern in the field of dentistry. The emergence of these blood clots is often attributed to damage suffered by the teeth. Damage could be caused by a range of factors such as tooth decay, trauma or injury. It is therefore essential to maintain good dental hygiene and to promptly seek dental care in case of any dental issues.

Studies have shown that the size of the pulp space and the calcification of the pulp tissue tend to diminish with age in the general population. However, the exact methodology used in these studies is not clearly explained. Bernick and Nedelman (1975) have pointed out that their tooth specimens show a clear trend in this regard. While the exact cause of this trend is not known, it is believed to be a natural part of the aging process.

Bernick's (1967) solo study suggested that the calcification process associated with aging is most apparent in the calcification of nerve tissue within the pulp. Nerve tissue calcification is a gradual process that changes with age. In younger individuals, including children between the ages of 15 and 18, small, calcified areas that are discrete and can be described as pulp stones are found in the endoneurium and perineurium. However, as individuals age, the circumferential process of calcification forms a ring around the nerve tissue.
