 With more advanced years, the calcification process starts to take over the nerve tissue itself, and eventually, the nerve tissue ends up being completely calcified.

It is important to note that the calcification of nerve tissue within the pulp can lead to various dental issues. For instance, it can trigger the emergence of blood clots within the central core of pulp stones. Blood clots can cause intense pain and discomfort, and may even lead to the need for a root canal or tooth extraction. Therefore, it is important to maintain good dental health through regular dental check-ups and prompt treatment of any dental issues.

The formation of pulp stones has been a topic of interest for many researchers in the field of dentistry. While there is no consensus on the relationship between aging and the prevalence of pulp stones, some researchers have suggested that there is a link between the two. However, not all researchers agree with this perspective.

One study conducted by Arys et al. in 1993 analyzed 42 molars removed from children between the ages of 5 and 13. The researchers used radiographic analysis to identify the presence of pulp stones and found that 78% of the specimens had them. Based on this finding, they concluded that aging has little or nothing to do with the formation of pulp stones. While this finding is not widely accepted, it does suggest that the prevalence of pulp stones is not solely related to aging.

However, other studies have contradicted this position. For example, our study found that the 40+ age group had a greater prevalence of pulp stones than the 18-to-40 cohort. This suggests that there may be some relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones, although more research is needed to fully understand this relationship.

Another study conducted by Moss-Salentijn and Klyvert in 1983 also found a large number of pulp stones in recently erupted and healthy teeth in children aged between 11 and 15. While the researchers did not claim that aging has no bearing on the formation of pulp stones, their findings do seem to support the position of Arys et al. that the prevalence of pulp stones is not solely related to aging.

Overall, the relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones is still not fully understood. While some studies suggest that aging has little or nothing to do with the prevalence of pulp stones, other studies have found a correlation between the two. Further research is needed to fully understand this relationship and its implications for dental health.

The formation of pulp stones in teeth has been a topic of interest for many researchers. While there is a general understanding that the formation of these stones is related to aging, there is still much to be learned about the specific factors that contribute to this process. One study, conducted by Moss-Salentijn and Klyvert, found that the pulp stones they discovered in children's teeth were true pulp stones. This suggests that false pulp stones, which are more commonly found in adult teeth, had not yet formed in the children's teeth.

However, it is important to note that most studies that have examined the type of pulp stones found in adult teeth have found that the majority of them are false pulp stones. This raises questions about the relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones.
