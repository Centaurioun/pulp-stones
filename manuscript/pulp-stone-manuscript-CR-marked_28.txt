 also examined the formation of pulp stones in adult teeth, but did not specify the type of pulp stones found. While it is impossible to know for certain what type of pulp stones were present in this study, it is reasonable to assume that many of them were true pulp stones.

This leads to the conclusion that the relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones is primarily related to false pulp stones. Prolonged exposure of pulp tissue to irritation and trauma is known to facilitate the formation of these false pulp stones. True pulp stones, on the other hand, may be formed under different circumstances.

Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to the formation of both true and false pulp stones. By gaining a better understanding of these processes, we may be able to develop more effective treatments for individuals who experience issues related to pulp stones.

The importance of maintaining good oral health cannot be overstated. It is essential to visit the dentist regularly and practice good dental hygiene habits such as brushing and flossing daily. However, even with proper care, sometimes teeth may require restorative treatment. In our study, we examined the prevalence of restorative treatment in relation to gender, age, and tooth type.

Out of the 5,851 teeth examined, 551 had undergone restorative treatment, accounting for 9.4% of the sample. We found that females had a higher prevalence of restorative treatment than males, with 11% of females compared to 8% of males having undergone the treatment. In terms of age, individuals aged older than 40 years had a slightly higher prevalence of restorative treatment than those aged between 18 and 40 years.

When we looked at the different types of teeth, we found that the prevalence of restorative treatment was highest in maxillary molars and mandibular molars, with 31% and 27.3% respectively. In contrast, the prevalence of restorative treatment was lowest in mandibular incisors and mandibular canines, with only 0.5% of both types of teeth having undergone the treatment. This could be due to the fact that molars are more susceptible to decay and damage, requiring restorative treatment more often.

Interestingly, we also found a correlation between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones. Pulp stones are small, calcified structures found in the dental pulp, and can cause pain and discomfort. We found that pulp stones were most common in maxillary molars and mandibular molars, with 42% and 36% respectively. In contrast, they were least common in mandibular incisors, with only 4.6% of these teeth having pulp stones. However, there was a difference in mandibular canines, with 12.6% of these teeth having pulp stones.

Further analysis revealed that teeth with restorations had a higher prevalence of pulp stones in all tooth type categories. This suggests that there is a link between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones. It is possible that restorative treatment may weaken the tooth structure, making it more susceptible to pulp stones.

In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of maintaining good oral health to prevent the need for restorative treatment. We also found a correlation between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

The presence of pulp stones has long been a topic of interest for dental professionals.
