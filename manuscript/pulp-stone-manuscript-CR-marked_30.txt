 For instance, Tamse et al. (1982) claimed that the health of the crown had no bearing on the presence of pulp stones. However, Ranjitkar et al. (2002) found a rate of 41.7% for pulp stones among teeth that were carious and had undergone restorative treatment, compared to 28.8% among healthy teeth. These results support the notion that there is a causal relationship between trauma, irritation, restoration, and pulp stones.

It is important to note that the presence of pulp stones is not always indicative of dental problems. In some cases, they may be asymptomatic and require no treatment. However, in other cases, they may cause pain, sensitivity, and inflammation, necessitating dental interventions such as root canal therapy. Therefore, it is crucial for dental professionals to be aware of the prevalence of pulp stones in teeth and to consider their potential impact on dental health when recommending restorative treatments. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between restorative treatment, trauma, irritation, and pulp stones in teeth.

Pulp stones are a common dental condition that can occur due to various reasons. These stones are formed within the pulp of teeth and can cause discomfort and pain if left untreated. The formation of pulp stones has been a topic of interest for researchers for many years, with studies attempting to identify the factors that contribute to their development.

One factor that has been extensively studied is the impact of trauma on the formation of pulp stones. Trauma to the teeth can occur due to various reasons such as accidents or injuries, and it has been suggested that this trauma can lead to the formation of pulp stones. However, the exact mechanism and time frame for this process is not clear.

In an attempt to analyze the direct impact of trauma on the formation of pulp stones, Subay et al. (2001) conducted a study where they applied extrusion with a force of 75g to 40 selected teeth. They then extracted these teeth after allowing a time period of between ten and forty days to pass. However, upon checking for the formation of pulp stones, they found no evidence of such. While this may appear to downplay the possible link between trauma and the formation of pulp stones, it is important to note that the exact mechanism and time frame for this process is still not clear.

Our study focused on examining the link between restorative treatment and the formation of pulp stones. Restorative treatment is a common dental procedure that involves repairing or replacing damaged teeth. The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth that have undergone restorative treatment was found to be significantly higher compared to unrestored teeth, regardless of the type of tooth or arch.

In terms of gender, our study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between males and females. However, it is important to note that further studies may be required to examine the impact of gender on the formation of pulp stones.

Overall, our study adds to the existing body of research on the formation of pulp stones and highlights the importance of considering restorative treatment as a potential factor in their development. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of pulp stones and to develop effective treatment strategies.
