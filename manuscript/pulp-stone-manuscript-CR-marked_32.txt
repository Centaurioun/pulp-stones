 When saliva production is reduced, the risk of dental decay increases, which may lead to the development of pulp stones.

Despite the fact that women are more likely to undergo restorative treatment than men, the prevalence of pulp stones has not been found to be significantly higher in women. However, this may be due to a variety of factors, including differences in the types of restorative procedures that men and women receive, variations in the severity of dental decay, and individual differences in oral health practices.

In conclusion, while women may be more likely to seek restorative treatment for their teeth than men, the underlying causes of this gender difference are complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to the development of pulp stones and other dental conditions, particularly in relation to gender differences. By gaining a better understanding of these issues, we can work towards developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies that address the unique needs of both men and women.

The impact of trauma on dental health cannot be overstated. While restoration and caries are well-known forms of dental trauma that can lead to pulp stone formation, there are other kinds of trauma that can also contribute to this issue. One such type of trauma is the kind induced by orthodontic treatment. Researchers Korkmaz, Aydın, and Sarıoğlu (2018) have found that pulp stones increase significantly in all tooth types after orthodontic treatment. This indicates that even seemingly routine dental procedures can have an impact on the formation of pulp stones.

Another study by Chen, Huang, and Yeh (2022) looked at the correlation between pulp stones and periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is another form of trauma or irritation that can affect dental health. The researchers found a greater prevalence of pulp stones in patients with periodontal disease overall compared to healthy individuals. This suggests that there may be a link between various forms of dental trauma and the formation of pulp stones.

One aspect of our own research that helps to demonstrate this fundamental causative link between pulp stones and trauma is the fact that molars display by far a higher prevalence of pulp stones compared to other types of teeth. Although molars with restorative treatment show a slightly greater prevalence of pulp stones compared to molars without restorative treatment, even this is outshined by the variation between molars and other types of teeth. This variation is itself caused by trauma. It is clear that the impact of trauma on dental health is a complex issue that requires further investigation and understanding. By exploring the various forms of trauma that can affect dental health, we can better understand the causes of pulp stone formation and work towards effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The molars, which are located at the back of the mouth, are subjected to a greater degree of wear and tear than other teeth due to their exposure to traumatic and irritating effects for a longer period of time. This increased exposure is due to the fact that molars are typically used for chewing and grinding food, which can cause them to become worn down and damaged over time.

Furthermore, molars are more susceptible to developing cavities and decay earlier than other teeth.
