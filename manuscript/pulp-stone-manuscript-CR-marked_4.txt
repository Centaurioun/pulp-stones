 The other type of false pulp stone, most often found in the root region of the tooth, has a central nidus formed from the remnants of cells that closely resemble HERS cells.

HERS cells, or epithelial root sheaths, are a group of cells that play an important role in tooth development. They are responsible for guiding the formation of roots and surrounding tissues. It is possible that remnants of these cells contributed to the formation of false pulp stones in the root region of the tooth.

The study of false pulp stones and denticles is an important area of research in dentistry. Understanding the formation and composition of these structures can help dentists better diagnose and treat dental conditions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Denticles, also known as true pulp stones, are a unique type of calcified tissue found in dental pulp. They are distinct from false pulp stones, which are more generalized in form and are thought to develop in response to trauma, such as dental procedures or injury.

One of the key differences between denticles and false pulp stones is their formation mechanisms. Denticles are believed to emerge naturally during root formation, whereas false pulp stones are thought to form because of other factors, such as injury or infection. This may explain why denticles tend to be softer and larger than false pulp stones.

Despite these differences, researchers are increasingly questioning the distinction between true and false pulp stones. Some experts have suggested scraping the true versus false pulp stone distinction altogether and instead proposed a new classification system based on the degree of calcification of the stones.

One argument for this change is that the difference between the true and false pulp stones is not always clear in practical terms. Many pulp stone specimens contain elements of both true and false pulp stones. This overlap between categories suggests that the current classification system may not accurately reflect the complex nature of pulp stone formation.

Overall, the study of pulp stones is an evolving field and, as new research emerges, our understanding of these structures and their formation mechanisms may continue to shift and change.

Pulp stones are calcified masses that form within the dental pulp of the teeth. These stones can contain a variety of materials, including dentin tissue, blood clots, and dead pulp cells. The classification of pulp stones can be a challenging task because there is often a significant amount of overlap between categories. One potential classification system is based on whether the stone contains dentin or not. Stones with a central core of dentin tissue were classified as true pulp stones, whereas those without dentin tissue were considered false pulp stones. However, this system can be confusing, as some false pulp stones may contain small amounts of dentin tissue.

Another potential classification system is based on the microanatomy of the pulp stones. Regular calcifications are smooth, round, or ovoid in shape with concentric laminations formed by multiple thin layers. On the other hand, irregular calcifications are more irregular in shape and lack distinct laminations of regular calcifications. Pulp stones with regular calcifications are commonly found in coronal portions of the pulp.
