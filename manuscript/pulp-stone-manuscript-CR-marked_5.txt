 However, even though this system has limitations, false pulp stones can also exhibit a concentric lamination appearance due to the coalescence of organic collagen fibers around the central nidus.

Despite these challenges, it is important for dental professionals to understand the formation and classification of pulp stones. Pulp stones can cause various dental problems, including pain, infection, and tooth decay. Treatment options for pulp stones include removal of the stone or root canal therapy in severe cases. By understanding the different types of pulp stones and their underlying causes, dental professionals can effectively diagnose and treat these conditions, ultimately improving the oral health of their patients.

Pulp stones are calcified masses usually found in the apical portions of the pulp. They are commonly described as having rough and irregular surfaces, and are mostly shaped like rods or leaves. Stones can be categorized into three main groups: true pulp stones, false pulp stones, and denticles.

True pulp stones are formed by the deposition of mineralized tissue within the pulp. They are typically round or oval in shape and have well-defined borders. True pulp stones are commonly found in the pulp chamber near the root apex and may be associated with trauma, aging, or genetic factors.

False pulp stones, on the other hand, are mainly composed of collagen fibers that attach to the surface of calcified masses. These stones tend to increase in size owing to the attachment of collagen fibers and are therefore more irregular in shape than true pulp stones. False pulp stones are usually found in the apical portions of the pulp and are often associated with dystrophic calcifications.

Denticles are small calcified masses that are usually found in the pulp chamber or root canal. They are typically round or oval in shape and have well-defined borders. Denticles are often associated with chronic pulpal inflammation or degenerative changes.

Diffuse pulp stones are a subtype of false pulp stones that are more irregular in shape than other types of false pulp stones. They are also sometimes termed ‘amorphous’ pulp stones. Diffuse pulp stones can emerge through changes, such as dystrophic calcification, and are closely related to blood vessels. Dystrophic calcification refers to the inappropriate biomineralization of pulp tissue without mineral imbalance. Diffuse pulp stones are sometimes considered as another type of pulp stone when classified in terms of composition, alongside true and false pulp stones and "denticles". Since the most common formation mechanism of diffuse pulp stones is dystrophic calcification, some researchers refer to diffuse pulp stones as simply "dystrophic calcifications.”

Understanding the different types of pulp stones can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of dental conditions.

Evaluation of the mineral components of pulp stones is an important area of research in dental science. Pulp stones are calcified structures that can form in the pulp chambers of teeth and can be detected using radiography. Previous studies have shown that pulp stones are composed of a variety of elements; however, the exact composition of these structures remains unclear.
