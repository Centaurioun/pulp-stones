To shed light on the mineral components of pulp stones, researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of these structures. The results of this analysis revealed that pulp stones are primarily composed of calcium and phosphorus, accounting for over 45% of their total mineral content. Other elements, including fluoride, sodium, and magnesium, were present in much lower concentrations. Additionally, trace amounts of potassium, chlorine, manganese, iron, and zinc were detected. To further investigate the properties of the pulp stones, two free pulp stones were removed from the centers of the pulp chambers of the extracted teeth. These stones were then subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using type I collagen and antibodies specific to non-collagenous proteins. Type-I collagens were homogenously established in every part of the pulp stones, indicating that these structures are an important component of the dentin matrix. Despite these findings, the study did not claim a clear difference in mineral composition between the mineral components of true and false pulp stones. Pulp stones can be challenging to diagnose, as they appear as lesions or radiopaque structures on radiography but do not necessarily have a clear image or uniform shape. This study provides valuable insights into the mineral composition and properties of pulp stones, which could aid in the development of new diagnostic and treatment approaches for dental conditions associated with these structures. Further research is needed to fully understand the formation and function of pulp stones in dentin matrix.

Pulp stones are a common finding on dental radiography and refer to calcified masses that form within the dental pulp. Calcifications can take on various shapes and sizes, ranging from tiny radiopacities to larger stones that occupy the entire pulp chamber. In some cases, pulp stones may occlude the pulpal space, leading to compromised blood supply and potential pulp necrosis.

Despite their prevalence, pulp stones are often asymptomatic and may go unnoticed without radiographic examination. Indeed, teeth containing pulp stones appear exactly the same as any other normal tooth, making it difficult to diagnose their presence without imaging. However, once identified, pulp stones can be monitored to ensure that they do not pose a risk to the health of teeth.

The number of pulp stones found in a single tooth can vary widely, with some teeth containing as few as one tooth and others harboring more than 12. However, the average number of pulp stones per tooth typically falls between the two extremes. It is also worth noting that although it is possible for a single tooth to contain more than 12 pulp stones, this is a relatively rare occurrence.

Pulp stone size is another factor that can vary widely, with some stones appearing as small particles and others occluding the entire pulp chamber. In general, pulp stones larger than 2 mm in diameter are visible on radiographs, whereas smaller stones may be missed. Additionally, free pulp stones that are not embedded in or adherent to the surrounding dentin are more readily discernible on radiography.

While pulp stones can occur in any tooth, they are most commonly found in molars, particularly in the first molars. This may be partly due to the fact that molars have larger pulp chambers than other teeth, providing more space for pulp stones to form.
