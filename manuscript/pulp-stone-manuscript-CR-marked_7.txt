 Nonetheless, pulp stones can occur in any tooth and should be monitored to ensure that they do not pose a risk to the dental health.

Dental health is a crucial aspect of overall health and wellbeing. One of the most common dental issues is degenerative changes, which can cause discomfort and pain in teeth and gums. One of the primary causes of degenerative changes is exposure to trauma such as dental caries, which can lead to the need for restorative treatment.

Interestingly, the first molars had a larger blood supply than the second molars and the premolars. This can lead to mineralization of a larger volume of blood clots, which can play a significant role in the formation of false pulp stones, particularly in relation to trauma. The formation of pulp stones is a common occurrence in the dental world and can be found in both maxillary and mandibular teeth. However, they are more commonly found in maxillary teeth by a slight degree, for reasons that are not entirely understood.

Notably, pulp stones appear more frequently in the coronal region of the pulp than in the apical region of teeth. The most common types of pulp stones are free pulp stones in terms of location and false pulp stones in terms of composition. Therefore, the most common specific subtypes of pulp stones are pulp stones that are both free and false.

Association of pulp stones with aging and distribution by age

Pulp stones, which are found in the dental pulp, are a common occurrence and have been subject to numerous studies. Despite the extensive research, the exact cause of pulp stones remains unknown, and their etiology remains poorly understood. There are various theories that suggest different reasons for pulp stone formation, including age, traumatic occlusion, general trauma, orthodontic treatment, pulpal circulatory disturbances, pulp degeneration, and aging.

One of the causes that many studies agree with is aging. Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, the frequency of pulp stones increases with age. Studies have shown that the prevalence of pulp stones increases with age, and this trend is consistent across different age groups. In a study conducted by Hill in 1934, 132 tooth specimens from various age groups were examined. They found that 66% of individuals aged 10–30 years had pulp stones, 80% of individuals aged 30–50 years had pulp stones, and 90% of individuals aged 50 and 70 had pulp stones. This study suggests that the frequency of pulp stones increases with age.

In a more recent study conducted by Hillmann and Geurtsen in 1997, 332 non-carious teeth from various age groups were analyzed. They found that the prevalence of pulp stones increased with age, with 14.9% of individuals aged 10–30 years having pulp stones, 44.4% of individuals aged 31–51 years having pulp stones, and 65.1% of individuals aged 52–72 years having pulp stones. This study provides further evidence that the prevalence of pulp stones increases with age.

Despite the consistent findings across studies, the exact mechanism by which aging contributes to pulp stone formation remains unclear. However, some researchers have suggested that changes in the composition of the dental pulp with age may play a role. As dental pulp ages, it undergoes various changes, including a decrease in the number of cells and an increase in the amount of collagen. These changes may contribute to the formation of pulp stones by altering the composition of the pulp.
