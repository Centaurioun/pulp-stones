# **INTRODUCTION**

## **Classification of pulp stones, formation mechanism and histology**
Pulp stones are small, nodular calcified masses that develop within the pulp cavities of the teeth (CR 1). The pulp cavity is the central part of a tooth and contains blood vessels, nerves, and other soft tissues. Pulp stones can form in all types of teeth, including healthy, diseased, impacted or unerupted teeth (CR 2). They can even form tooth-like structures in the dermoid cysts.

Interestingly, pulp stones are not a novel phenomenon. They have been observed in human remains dating back to ancient civilizations (CR 3). Some researchers have suggested that the presence of pulp stones in ancient teeth may have been a result of poor oral hygiene, a high-sugar diet, or other factors that are known to contribute to dental problems (CR 4).

Despite their prevalence, pulp stones are not fully understood. Several possible causes have been identified (CR 5). These include trauma to the tooth, genetic factors, inflammation, and changes in the pH of the pulp tissue (CR 6).

Different types of pulp stones can be classified according to their location or structure. In terms of location, pulp stones can be classified as either "free", "embedded", or "adherent" (CR 7). Free pulp stones are completely surrounded by the pulp tissue and can be easily removed. Embedded pulp stones are partially embedded within the dentin and the hard outer layer of the tooth. Adherent pulp stones are firmly attached to the dentin and cannot be easily removed.

In addition to their location, pulp stones can be classified based on their structure (CR 8). Some pulp stones are composed of a single layer of calcified tissue, whereas others have a layered structure with multiple layers of calcified tissue. The size and shape of pulp stones can also vary, with some being small and round, whereas others are larger and irregularly shaped (CR 9).

Odontoblasts are an important component of the dental pulp. They are derived from the neural crest cells and are found on the outer surface of the pulp (CR 10). These cells have a peripheral resemblance to dentin and are responsible for synthesizing the dentin matrix and controlling dentin mineralization (CR 11). In the coronal portion of the pulp chamber, odontoblast cells were particularly abundant, with a frequency of 45,000-65,000 per mm2 (CR 12). However, they were less frequent in the cervical and middle-root areas.

The concentration of true pulp stones was also the highest in the coronal portion of the pulp chamber, where odontoblastic cells were the most abundant (CR 13). These true pulp stones were composed of dentin lined with odontoblasts (CR 14). Interestingly, the confinement of dentin by odontoblasts in terms of true pulp stones is not always done by true odontoblasts but by odontoblast-like cells containing tubules (CR 15). This highlights the diverse nature of odontoblasts and their ability to adapt to different situations.

The cellular products secreted by odontoblasts may also play a role in the formation of true pulp stones (CR 16). These products aid in the sticking of odontoblasts to the core of dentin tissue, which is surrounded by a small central cavity of cell remnants (CR 17). This cavity is generally distinct from the cell remnants found in false pulp stones, as previously described.

It is important to note that true pulp stones are rare and present in a minority of pulp stones (CR 18). False pulp stones, however, are more common and are composed of calcified tissue that does not contain odontoblasts (CR 19). False pulp stones can be caused by various factors, including trauma, inflammation, and aging (CR 20).

The process of mineralization of degenerating pulp tissue is complex and involves not only pulp cells but also other elements, such as blood clots and organic collagen fibers (CR 21). While true pulp stones are composed only of remnants of dead pulp cells, false pulp stones contain a greater mass and volume of material, including blood clots and organic collagen fibers (CR 22). These fibers typically surround the core of blood clots and dead pulp cells, creating a complex matrix that is difficult to study.

Recent research has shed new light on the nature of false pulp stones and their relationship to Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) (CR 23). In a study in which clusters of cells were sampled through intrusions from pre-stone mineralizing organic material transitioning into false pulp stones, an abundance of cells of epithelial origin in the root area was discovered (CR 24). These cells had a particular resemblance to HERS cells, which are epithelial tissue layers that play an important role in root formation (CR 25). HERS cells form transient structures during the early stages of root formation and elongation, and their presence in false pulp stones suggests a complex interplay between pulp tissue and the surrounding dental structures (CR 26).

Understanding the processes that lead to the formation of false pulp stones is important for the development of new treatments for dental conditions, such as pulpitis and pulp necrosis (CR 27). By unraveling the complex interactions between pulp tissue, blood clots, and organic collagen fibers, researchers hope to develop more effective therapies for these conditions, ultimately improving the quality of life of patients suffering from dental pain and discomfort. As our understanding of the nature of false pulp stones continues to evolve, it is clear that this area of research holds great promise in the future of dental medicine.

Pulp stones are calcifications that occur within the pulp tissue of the teeth (CR 28). These stones can vary in size, shape, and location within the pulp chamber, and can be classified into three distinct categories: free, embedded, and adherent (CR 29).

Free pulp stones are the most common type of pulp stones and are not attached to the pulp wall (CR 30). They can be freely found floating within the pulp chamber and are often composed of dentin tissue (CR 31).

Embedded pulp stones, however, are entirely surrounded by dentin tissue and are therefore buried within the canal walls of the pulp chamber (CR 32). These stones are most commonly found in the apical portion of the pulp and are generally classified as tertiary dentine (CR 33).

Adherent pulp stones are attached to the pulp wall, but are not entirely surrounded by dentin tissue (CR 34). Instead, they are partly fused with dentin and partly surrounded by soft tissue. The classification of embedded and adherent pulp stones can be subjective and difficult to discern, leading some researchers to classify them together as "attached" pulp stones.

Pulp stones can be classified as either "true" or "false" in terms of their structure or composition (CR 35). True pulp stones are composed of dentin tissue, whereas false pulp stones are composed of other calcified materials such as cementum or enamel (CR 36).

Although pulp stones are generally considered harmless, they can sometimes cause complications in dental procedures, such as root canals (CR 37). Additionally, some studies have suggested that pulp stones may be associated with certain systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CR 38). Further research is required to fully understand the implications of pulp stones on overall health.

Odontoblasts are an important component of the dental pulp. They are derived from the neural crest cells and are found on the outer surface of the pulp (CR 39). These cells have a peripheral resemblance to dentin and are responsible for synthesizing the dentin matrix and controlling dentin mineralization (CR 40). In the coronal portion of the pulp chamber, odontoblast cells were particularly abundant, with a frequency of 45,000-65,000 per mm2 (CR 41). However, they were less frequent in the cervical and middle-root areas.

The concentration of true pulp stones was also the highest in the coronal portion of the pulp chamber, where odontoblastic cells were the most abundant (CR 42). These true pulp stones were composed of dentin lined with odontoblasts (CR 43). Interestingly, the confinement of dentin by odontoblasts in terms of true pulp stones is not always done by true odontoblasts but by odontoblast-like cells containing tubules (CR 44). This highlights the diverse nature of odontoblasts and their ability to adapt to different situations.

The cellular products secreted by odontoblasts may also play a role in the formation of true pulp stones (CR 45). These products aid in the sticking of odontoblasts to the core of dentin tissue, which is surrounded by a small central cavity of cell remnants (CR 46). This cavity is generally distinct from the cell remnants found in false pulp stones, as previously described.

It is important to note that true pulp stones are rare and present in a minority of pulp stones (CR 47). False pulp stones, however, are more common and are composed of calcified tissue that does not contain odontoblasts (CR 48). False pulp stones can be caused by various factors, including trauma, inflammation, and aging (CR 49).

The process of mineralization of degenerating pulp tissue is complex and involves not only pulp cells but also other elements, such as blood clots and organic collagen fibers (CR 50). While true pulp stones are composed only of remnants of dead pulp cells, false pulp stones contain a greater mass and volume of material, including blood clots and organic collagen fibers (CR 51). These fibers typically surround the core of blood clots and dead pulp cells, creating a complex matrix that is difficult to study.

Recent research has shed new light on the nature of false pulp stones and their relationship to Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) (CR 52). In a study in which clusters of cells were sampled through intrusions from pre-stone mineralizing organic material transitioning into false pulp stones, an abundance of cells of epithelial origin in the root area was discovered (CR 53).

HERS cells form transient structures during the early stages of root formation and elongation, and their presence in false pulp stones suggests a complex interplay between pulp tissue and the surrounding dental structures (CR 55).

Understanding the processes that lead to the formation of false pulp stones is important for the development of new treatments for dental conditions, such as pulpitis and pulp necrosis (CR 56). By unraveling the complex interactions between pulp tissue, blood clots, and organic collagen fibers, researchers hope to develop more effective therapies for these conditions, ultimately improving the quality of life of patients suffering from dental pain and discomfort. As our understanding of the nature of false pulp stones continues to evolve, it is clear that this area of research holds great promise in the future of dental medicine.

## **Association of pulp stones with aging and distribution by age**

Pulp stones, which are found in the dental pulp, are a common occurrence and have been subject to numerous studies (CR 57). Despite the extensive research, the exact cause of pulp stones remains unknown, and their etiology remains poorly understood (CR 58). There are various theories that suggest different reasons for pulp stone formation, including age, traumatic occlusion, general trauma, orthodontic treatment, pulpal circulatory disturbances, pulp degeneration, and aging (CR 59).

One of the causes that many studies agree with is aging (CR 60). Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, the frequency of pulp stones increases with age (CR 61). Studies have shown that the prevalence of pulp stones increases with age, and this trend is consistent across different age groups. In a study conducted by Hill in 1934, 132 tooth specimens from various age groups were examined (CR 62). They found that 66% of individuals aged 10–30 years had pulp stones, 80% of individuals aged 30–50 years had pulp stones, and 90% of individuals aged 50 and 70 had pulp stones. This study suggests that the frequency of pulp stones increases with age.

In a more recent study conducted by Hillmann and Geurtsen in 1997, 332 non-carious teeth from various age groups were analyzed (CR 63). They found that the prevalence of pulp stones increased with age, with 14.9% of individuals aged 10–30 years having pulp stones, 44.4% of individuals aged 31–51 years having pulp stones, and 65.1% of individuals aged 52–72 years having pulp stones. This study provides further evidence that the prevalence of pulp stones increases with age.

Despite the consistent findings across studies, the exact mechanism by which aging contributes to pulp stone formation remains unclear (CR 64). However, some researchers have suggested that changes in the composition of the dental pulp with age may play a role (CR 65). As dental pulp ages, it undergoes various changes, including a decrease in the number of cells and an increase in the amount of collagen. These changes may contribute to the formation of pulp stones by altering the composition of the pulp.

In conclusion, while the exact cause of pulp stones remains unknown, research suggests that aging is a significant contributor to their formation (CR 66). Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms by which aging contributes to pulp stone formation, which could lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies.

Udoye and Sede (2011) conducted a study that suggested that pulp stones tend to form after an individual reaches their fourth decade of life (CR 67). The process of aging causes the pulp to gradually decrease in size due to the deposition of secondary and tertiary dentin (CR 68). This results in conditions that are conducive to pulp calcification, which leads to the formation of pulp stones. The age range of 40 to 50 years is considered to be a period of special strength for the formation of these stones (CR 69).

As the pulp space decreases with age, tooth damage, dental caries, and operative interventions for treatment, including restorative treatment, can aggravate this process and increase it naturally with advancing age (CR 70). Trauma may be the most significant aggravating factor, with damage being the primary cause of blood clot formation, most often found in the central nidus of false pulp stones (CR 71). The formation of pulp stones may also be a natural process that occurs with age, independent of damage, caries, treatment, or disease (CR 72). This points to a fundamental link between aging and the development of pulp stones, although the impact of trauma and irritation remains significant.

The effects of aging on the dental pulp are complex, and it is difficult to draw a clear line between aging and physiological processes, including the effects of trauma (CR 73). As individuals age, their bodies undergo a range of changes that can affect the health of their teeth and gums (CR 74). These changes can include the loss of bone density, decreased saliva production, and an increased risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CR 75). All of these factors can contribute to the development of pulp stones and other dental problems.

In conclusion, while the formation of pulp stones is a complex process that can be influenced by a range of factors, including age, trauma, and disease, it is clear that aging plays a significant role in the development of these stones (CR 76). As an individual age, it is important to take steps to maintain good dental health, including regular dental check-ups, proper oral hygiene, and a healthy diet. By doing so, individuals can help reduce their risk of developing dental problems such as pulp stones and maintain good overall health and well-being.

The study conducted by Bernick in 1967 examined the calcification process of nerve tissue within the pulp and found that the process is progressive, with a gradual increase in calcification of the pulp over time (CR 77). The report also described the formation of discrete calcified regions leading to the development of stones in the endoneurium and perineurium of younger individuals (CR 78). As an individual age, the calcification process becomes circumferential, resulting in the creation of a ring of calcifications around the nerve tissue (CR 79).

With further aging, the nerve fibers themselves become invaded by calcification, which ultimately destroys the nerve tissue (CR 80). Bernick and Nedelman's report in 1975 also discussed an increase in collagenous bundles in the coronal pulp tissues of older individuals, which serve as foci for false pulp stone formation (CR 81).

As an individual ages, the number of cells within the pulp tissue decreases, and they are increasingly replaced by collagenous bundles and fat deposits (CR 82). These materials also serve as loci for pulp stone formation. This process continues until there is nothing left in the pulp except for these materials.

The calcification of the pulp tissue can have serious consequences for dental health (CR 83). Pulp stones can cause discomfort and pain, and they can also interfere with dental procedures such as root canals (CR 84). It is therefore essential to monitor the calcification process and take appropriate measures to prevent the formation of pulp stones in older adults (CR 85). This can include regular dental check-ups, maintaining good oral hygiene, and avoiding certain dietary habits that can contribute to the development of pulp stones. With proper care, it is possible to maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout one's life.

Pulp stones, also known as denticles, are calcified structures that can be found in the dental pulp of teeth (CR 86). These stones have been studied extensively, as they can have an impact on dental health and treatment outcomes (CR 87). Different studies have suggested that there is great variance in the prevalence of pulp stones between different ethnicities and populations (CR 88). This variation is likely due to differences in methodology used in these studies.

For example, a survey of a large sample of the population of northern India by Bains et al. found that the prevalence of pulp stones in the sampled population was 41.8% (CR 89). However, other studies have reported lower prevalence rates in different populations (CR 90). This suggests that the prevalence of pulp stones is not uniform across all populations and is influenced by several factors.

One of the primary reasons for this great variation in prevalence and prevalence results is likely a difference in methodology (CR 91). Some studies have defined prevalence as individuals, while others have defined it as tooth specimens. In other words, some studies counted an individual possessing at least one pulp stone in total as a positive result, while others counted tooth specimens containing pulp stones as positive results out of the number of studied teeth. Performing the count in terms of individuals naturally greatly increases prevalence, whereas specifically looking at teeth reduces the result. This suggests the need for clear descriptions and uniformity of methods in the literature on pulp stones.

Regarding distribution by gender, Stafne and Szabo (1933) made the general observation that pulp stones were more common in men compared to women (CR 92). However, further research is needed to confirm this observation, as other studies have reported conflicting results.

In addition to variations in prevalence and prevalence results, pulp stones can also vary in size and location within the dental pulp (CR 93). Some stones may be small and localized, while others may be larger and distributed throughout the pulp. The size and location of pulp stones can impact treatment outcomes, as larger stones may be more difficult to remove and may result in more complications (CR 94).

Overall, the study of pulp stones is an important area of research in dentistry. By understanding the prevalence, size, and location of these stones, dental professionals can better diagnose and treat dental conditions. However, it is important to ensure that research methods are standardized and clearly described in order to accurately compare findings across different studies and populations.

In a study conducted on 150 male and 150 female individuals aged between 20 and 40 years, researchers analyzed 1380 mandibular premolars and molars to determine the prevalence of pulp stones (CR 95). The overall result of the study indicated that 20.7% of the teeth had pulp stones, with molars having a much higher prevalence than premolars (CR 96). Interestingly, the prevalence of pulp stones in female teeth was higher than that of male teeth, with 24.7% and 16.9%, respectively (CR 97). However, the reason for this difference is unknown and was not investigated further in the study.

It is important to note that there may not be significant differences between males and females in younger individuals. In a study conducted by Baghdady et al. in 1988, specimens from 515 boys and girls aged 12 and 13 were analyzed, and the overall prevalence of pulp stones in the sample was 19.2%, with 18.8% in females and 19.8% in males (CR 98).

It is worth mentioning that the true prevalence of pulp stones in the general population is likely higher than that detected through radiographic analysis (CR 99). This is because only pulp stones with a diameter greater than 2 mm are detectable with radiographic analysis, and free pulp stones are also more readily discernible on radiography than embedded and adherent pulp stones (CR 100).

## **Clinical implications**

Despite the prevalence of pulp stones, it is important to note that they do not cause pain unless they impinge on nerves. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to maintain good oral hygiene practices and regularly visit their dentist for check-ups and cleanings to prevent any dental issues from arising.

Pulp stones are a common occurrence in dental patients and can cause a number of issues during endodontic treatment. While nerves can often cause idiopathic pain, they do not typically lead to any other discomfort beyond the possibility of nerve impingement and idiopathic pain. It's important to note that nerves are not a cause of pulpitis, and therefore do not have clear clinical implications or require treatment.

However, pulp stones can interfere with endodontic treatment and should be removed in cases where the interference is particularly strong. The degree of interference depends on the size and location of the stones. For instance, larger pulp stones in the pulp chamber can cause blockage of the root canal openings and impede the movement of dental instruments through the canal. Pulp stones also cause greater blockage if they are located on a curve in the root canal.

It's important to note that embedded and adherent pulp stones have a greater risk of interfering with root canal treatment than free pulp stones, based on both their location and size. No distinction has been found in the literature regarding the relationship between true and false pulp stones.

Therefore, it's essential that dental professionals take note of the presence and location of pulp stones when treating patients for endodontic issues. While pulp stones may not require treatment in principle, they can cause significant problems during treatment and should be addressed accordingly. It's also important that patients communicate any discomfort or pain they may be experiencing to their dental professional, as this can be an indication of nerve impingement or other issues that may require treatment. Overall, understanding the role of pulp stones in endodontic treatment is a crucial component of providing high-quality dental care.

Canals are a common dental procedure that involves removing the pulp of a tooth due to infection or decay. During this process, pulp stones may be discovered, which are small, round calcifications that form within the pulp chamber of a tooth. While they are not harmful, they can cause pain and discomfort for some patients.

To remove pulp stones, dentists typically use burs and ultrasonic instruments. In some cases, sodium hypochlorite may be used as a synergistic material to dissolve the stones. However, it is believed that sodium hypochlorite is more effective in dissolving false pulp stones than true pulp stones due to differences in composition. Nevertheless, the majority of pulp stones found in practice are false.

Patients with pulp-related idiopathic pain may have a high prevalence of pulp stones when examined. However, it is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between the two. A study by Moody et al. (1989) found that the presence of pulp stones does not affect the threshold for electric pulp testing.

Despite their low clinical significance, pulp stones have been the subject of over 400 articles in the PubMed database. However, many of these articles pertain to general pulp calcification rather than actual pulp stones.

In conclusion, while pulp stones may cause discomfort for some patients, they are not harmful and can be easily removed through common dental procedures. Further research may be needed to better understand the relationship between pulp stones and pulp-related pain.

The study of pulp stones and calcifications within the dental field has been a topic of interest for many years. However, much of the research conducted in this area has focused primarily on radiographic analysis and prevalence in different populations. While this information is certainly useful, it does not provide a complete understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to the formation of these dental anomalies.

One of the main issues with previous research on pulp stones and calcifications is that it has largely ignored the potential causes of these conditions. Without a thorough understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to the development of pulp stones, it is difficult to develop effective treatment strategies. This is particularly true when it comes to endodontic treatment, which is a field that relies heavily on accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Thankfully, recent advances in imaging technology have made it possible to gain a better understanding of pulp stones and calcifications. One such technology is cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), which has been used in studies in Turkey with promising results. However, despite the potential benefits of this technology, it is still underutilized in many parts of the world.

The use of CBCT in this thesis study represents a novel approach to the study of pulp stones and calcifications. By utilizing this technology with a large sample size, we hope to gain a better understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to the formation of these dental anomalies. This, in turn, may lead to more effective endodontic treatment strategies that can improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

Overall, the study of pulp stones and calcifications is an important area of research within the dental field. By continuing to explore these conditions and their underlying causes, we can develop more effective treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes. With the use of advanced imaging technologies like CBCT, we are poised to make significant progress in this area of research in the coming years.

Overall, while pulp stones can occur in any tooth, they are most commonly found in molars, particularly in the first molars (CR 101). This may be partly due to the fact that molars have larger pulp chambers than other teeth, providing more space for pulp stones to form (CR 102). Nonetheless, pulp stones can occur in any tooth and should be monitored to ensure that they do not pose a risk to the dental health.

Dental health is a crucial aspect of overall health and wellbeing. One of the most common dental issues is degenerative changes, which can cause discomfort and pain in teeth and gums (CR 103). One of the primary causes of degenerative changes is exposure to trauma such as dental caries, which can lead to the need for restorative treatment (CR 104).

Interestingly, the first molars had a larger blood supply than the second molars and the premolars (CR 105). This can lead to mineralization of a larger volume of blood clots, which can play a significant role in the formation of false pulp stones, particularly in relation to trauma (CR 106). The formation of pulp stones is a common occurrence in the dental world and can be found in both maxillary and mandibular teeth (CR 107). However, they are more commonly found in maxillary teeth by a slight degree, for reasons that are not entirely understood (CR 108).

Notably, pulp stones appear more frequently in the coronal region of the pulp than in the apical region of teeth (CR 109). The most common types of pulp stones are free pulp stones in terms of location and false pulp stones in terms of composition (CR 110). Therefore, the most common specific subtypes of pulp stones are pulp stones that are both free and false.

Pulp stones, also known as denticles, are calcified structures that can be found in the dental pulp of teeth (CR 111). These stones have been studied extensively, as they can have an impact on dental health and treatment outcomes (CR 112). Different studies have suggested that there is great variance in the prevalence of pulp stones between different ethnicities and populations (CR 113). This variation is likely due to differences in methodology used in these studies.

For example, a survey of a large sample of the population of northern India by Bains et al. found that the prevalence of pulp stones in the sampled population was 41.8% (CR 114). However, other studies have reported lower prevalence rates in different populations (CR 115). This suggests that the prevalence of pulp stones is not uniform across all populations and is influenced by several factors.

One of the primary reasons for this great variation in prevalence and prevalence results is likely a difference in methodology (CR 116). Some studies have defined prevalence as individuals, while others have defined it as tooth specimens. In other words, some studies counted an individual possessing at least one pulp stone in total as a positive result, while others counted tooth specimens containing pulp stones as positive results out of the number of studied teeth. Performing the count in terms of individuals naturally greatly increases prevalence, whereas specifically looking at teeth reduces the result. This suggests the need for clear descriptions and uniformity of methods in the literature on pulp stones.

Regarding distribution by gender, Stafne and Szabo (1933) made the general observation that pulp stones were more common in men compared to women (CR 117). However, further research is needed to confirm this observation, as other studies have reported conflicting results.

In addition to variations in prevalence and prevalence results, pulp stones can also vary in size and location within the dental pulp (CR 118). Some stones may be small and localized, while others may be larger and distributed throughout the pulp. The size and location of pulp stones can impact treatment outcomes, as larger stones may be more difficult to remove and may result in more complications (CR 119).

Overall, the study of pulp stones is an important area of research in dentistry. By understanding the prevalence, size, and location of these stones, dental professionals can better diagnose and treat dental conditions. However, it is important to ensure that research methods are standardized and clearly described in order to accurately compare findings across different studies and populations.

## **Association of pulp stones with systemic illnesses**

In addition to the debate surrounding the role of age in pulp stone formation, there is also a possible association between pulp stones and systemic illnesses (CR 120). While this has not been rigorously studied, previous research by Stafne and Szabo in 1933 found a correlation between pulp stones and arteriosclerosis, osteitis deformans, and acromegaly (CR 121). However, they did not find any link between pulp stones and other illnesses such as cholelithiasis, renal lithiasis, gout, hypercementosis, migraine, and torus linguae/palatinus.

Overall, while there is still much to be learned about the formation and association of pulp stones, these studies provide valuable insights into the factors that may contribute to their development (CR 122). Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind their formation and potential links to systemic illnesses.

A study conducted by Edds et al. (2005) found that there was a significant increase in the prevalence of pulp stones in patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease compared to those who were healthy (CR 123). The study discovered that individuals with cardiovascular disease were more likely to develop pulp stones, which are small, hard masses of mineralized tissue that form in the dental pulp (CR 124). This finding suggests that there may be a correlation between cardiovascular disease and dental health, which warrants further investigation.

In addition to cardiovascular disease, there are other tentative correlations between diseases and illnesses and an increased prevalence of pulp stones (CR 125). However, there is currently no proof of causation. Late-stage renal failure, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Calcinosis universalis, tumoral calcinosis, and Marfan syndrome are some of the diseases and illnesses that are thought to be associated with a greater prevalence of pulp stones (CR 126). Van der Woude's syndrome is also believed to be related to pulp stones.

Interestingly, there appears to be a particular connection between the presence of pulp stones and renal issues (CR 127). Studies have shown a correlation between pulp stones and renal stones, with individuals who have three or more teeth containing pulp stones being 5.78 times more likely to have renal stones compared to those who have pulp stones in fewer than three of their teeth (CR 128). This finding suggests that there may be a link between the formation of pulp stones and the development of renal stones.

Similarly, Kaswan et al. (2014) explored a potential correlation between pulp stones and stones in salivary glands (CR 129). The study found that individuals with a large number of pulp stones were likely to have a large number of stones embedded in their salivary glands (CR 130). This finding suggests that there may be a relationship between the formation of pulp stones and the development of salivary gland stones.

Overall, these findings suggest that there may be a connection between dental health and certain diseases and illnesses (CR 131). Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between pulp stones and various health conditions, and to determine whether the presence of pulp stones can serve as an indicator of underlying health issues.

The study conducted by Mathew et al. (2019) has suggested a possible correlation between the occurrence of pulp stones and diabetes (CR 132). Marfan syndrome, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissues in the body (CR 133). As a result, individuals with this condition are prone to connective tissue dysplasia and vascular defects, which can lead to endothelial rupture of the pulp arterioles (CR 134). This rupture can cause hemorrhage within the pulp and induce mineralization, especially of the ensuing blood clots.

Apart from diabetes and Marfan syndrome, there are other possible links and correlations in terms of systemic diseases (CR 135). For instance, patients with tumoral calcinosis, dentin dysplasia type II, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, elfin facies syndrome, familial expansile osteolysis, and otodental syndrome have also been found to have a higher incidence of pulp stones (CR 136). These systemic diseases affect different parts of the body, yet they all seem to share a common denominator of causing the formation of pulp stones.

The overall trend in the literature is that there is a causative link between the existence of pulp stones and systemic illnesses (CR 137). In fact, Bains et al. (2014) have suggested that the presence of large numbers of pulp stones could be used as an indicator of distinct types of systemic diseases (CR 138). This means that the occurrence of pulp stones can be an early marker for systemic illnesses, which can help in early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

In conclusion, the formation of pulp stones is not a stand-alone occurrence, but rather a manifestation of underlying systemic diseases (CR 139). Therefore, it is important for dental practitioners to understand the possible correlations between pulp stones and systemic diseases so that they can provide the right diagnosis and treatment for their patients (CR 140). Additionally, patients with a higher incidence of pulp stones should also be screened for systemic diseases to ensure early detection and management.

## **Association with caries and restorative treatment**

Pulp stone formation is a phenomenon that has been studied extensively by researchers in the field of dentistry. It refers to the calcification of the pulp tissue in teeth, which can occur due to a variety of factors (CR 141). One of the most commonly cited causes of pulp stone formation is chronic pulp irritation (CR 142). This occurs when the pulp tissue in a tooth is exposed to constant trauma or irritation, which can lead to the formation of calcified deposits within the pulp.

Studies have shown that there is a strong causal relationship between chronic pulp irritation and the formation of false pulp stones (CR 143). False pulp stones are calcified deposits that form within the pulp tissue as a result of trauma or irritation, rather than as a natural part of the tooth's development. Researchers have found that caries and restorations in the hand can be significant sources of chronic pulp irritation, which can trigger the formation of false pulp stones (CR 144).

One study conducted in Australia and Malaysia focused on first molars among a group of patients. The study found that first molars that had received restorative treatment or were currently suffering from caries were more likely to have pulp stones than healthy, intact, and unrestored molars (CR 145). The majority of these pulp stones were found to be false, which supports the idea that chronic pulp irritation is a major factor in their formation.

Another study conducted in Australia by Ranjitkar et al. found that teeth that had received restorative treatment and/or were carious had a much higher frequency of pulp stones compared to healthy and intact teeth (CR 146). The study found that 41.7% of restored and/or carious teeth contained pulp stones, as opposed to 28.8% of healthy teeth containing pulp stones.

Overall, these studies suggest that chronic pulp irritation is a significant factor in the formation of false pulp stones (CR 147). This highlights the importance of proper dental care and the prevention of caries and other forms of dental trauma in order to maintain healthy pulp tissue in teeth.

The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth is an important aspect of dental health research. In this study, the prevalence of pulp stones in various types of teeth was examined. The results showed that the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary molars (14.5%) was higher than in other types of teeth, such as maxillary incisors (4.7%), mandibular incisors (4.6%), and maxillary canines (4.6%) (CR 148). This difference was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the study also looked at the prevalence of restorative treatment in different types of teeth. The results revealed that the prevalence of restorative treatment in maxillary molars (31%) and mandibular molars (27.4%) was significantly higher compared to other types of teeth, such as maxillary incisors (4.8%), mandibular incisors (0.5%), maxillary canines (3.7%), mandibular canines (0.5%), maxillary premolars (9.6%), and mandibular premolars (6.8%) (p < 0.05) (CR 149). The prevalence of restorative treatment in maxillary premolars (9.6%) was also found to be significantly higher compared to other types of teeth, such as maxillary incisors (4.8%), mandibular incisors (0.5%), maxillary canines (3.7%), and mandibular canines (0.5%) (p < 0.05) (CR 150).

Interestingly, the study also found that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between the maxilla and mandible (p > 0.05) (CR 151). However, the prevalence of restorative treatment was significantly higher in the maxilla (11.9%) compared to the mandible (7%) (CR 152).

These findings highlight the importance of regular dental check-ups and proper oral hygiene practices to prevent the development of dental issues such as pulp stones and the need for restorative treatment. Additionally, the results of this study provide valuable information for dental professionals to better understand the prevalence of these issues in different types of teeth and areas of the mouth.

The presence of pulp stones in teeth is a common occurrence that can have significant implications for dental health. Pulp stones are calcified structures that form in the pulp chamber of teeth and can lead to complications such as pulpitis and necrosis (CR 153). The prevalence of pulp stones can vary depending on a number of factors, including age, gender, and dental treatment history.

In a recent study, researchers investigated the prevalence of pulp stones in different types of teeth with and without restorative treatment. The study found that in maxillary incisors, there was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between teeth with and without restorative treatment (CR 154). Specifically, the prevalence of pulp stones was higher in teeth with restorative treatment compared to those without. This finding highlights the potential impact of restorative treatment on the development of pulp stones in maxillary incisors.

Interestingly, in mandibular incisors, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between teeth with and without restorative treatment (CR 155). This suggests that the relationship between restorative treatment and pulp stone formation may vary depending on the specific tooth type. Further research is needed to better understand these differences and their implications for dental health.

In maxillary and mandibular canines and premolars, there was also no significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between teeth with and without restorative treatment (CR 156). This further emphasizes the need for more targeted investigation into the mechanisms underlying pulp stone formation and the potential impact of restorative treatment.

Overall, this study highlights the complex relationship between restorative treatment and pulp stone formation in different types of teeth. By better understanding these relationships, dental professionals can develop more effective strategies for preventing and treating pulp stone complications.

The study investigated the prevalence of pulp stones in the maxillary and mandibular molars of patients who had undergone restorative treatment and those who had not. The study found that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between teeth with and without restorative treatment in mandibular molars (CR 157). However, in the maxilla and mandible, teeth with restorative treatment had a significantly higher prevalence of pulp stones compared to teeth without restorative treatment (CR 158).

The overall prevalence of pulp stones in the sampled tooth specimens was found to be 13.7% (CR 159). Of all teeth, 9.4% had undergone restorative treatment (CR 160). Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in pulp stone prevalence between genders or between the maxilla and the mandible (CR 161). However, the prevalence of pulp stones was found to be higher in the age group of 41 and above compared to the 18–40 age group, indicating a statistically significant prevalence of pulp stones in older patients (CR 162).

The study's findings suggest that restorative treatment may increase the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary and mandibular molars (CR 163). Pulp stones can cause inflammation and pain, leading to the need for further treatment. Therefore, dentists should be aware of this potential complication when considering restorative treatment for their patients.

Further research is needed to investigate the exact mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of pulp stones in teeth with restorative treatment (CR 164). Additionally, studies examining the effectiveness of preventive measures to reduce the risk of pulp stones in patients undergoing restorative treatment would be beneficial.

The presence of pulp stones in teeth can be a cause for concern, as they can lead to various dental problems. Studies have shown that there is a correlation between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones in teeth (CR 165). In the maxilla, the incidence of pulp stones in teeth with restorative treatment was found to be 28% compared to 11.2% in teeth without restorative treatment (CR 166). Similarly, in the mandible, 30.1% of teeth with restorative treatment contained pulp stones, compared to 13% of teeth without restorative treatment (CR 167).

There have been numerous studies conducted on the possible links between pulp stones and restorative treatment, as well as the overall impact of trauma and irritation on the health status of teeth (CR 168). While most of these studies suggest that there is a correlation between caries and restorative treatment on one hand and the formation of pulp stones on the other, not all of them do so. For instance, Tamse et al. (1982) claimed that the health of the crown had no bearing on the presence of pulp stones (CR 169). However, Ranjitkar et al. (2002) found a rate of 41.7% for pulp stones among teeth that were carious and had undergone restorative treatment, compared to 28.8% among healthy teeth. These results support the notion that there is a causal relationship between trauma, irritation, restoration, and pulp stones (CR 170).

It is important to note that the presence of pulp stones is not always indicative of dental problems (CR 171). In some cases, they may be asymptomatic and require no treatment. However, in other cases, they may cause pain, sensitivity, and inflammation, necessitating dental interventions such as root canal therapy (CR 172). Therefore, it is crucial for dental professionals to be aware of the prevalence of pulp stones in teeth and to consider their potential impact on dental health when recommending restorative treatments. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between restorative treatment, trauma, irritation, and pulp stones in teeth (CR 173).

Pulp stones are a common dental condition that can occur due to various reasons (CR 174). These stones are formed within the pulp of teeth and can cause discomfort and pain if left untreated (CR 175). The formation of pulp stones has been a topic of interest for researchers for many years, with studies attempting to identify the factors that contribute to their development.

One factor that has been extensively studied is the impact of trauma on the formation of pulp stones (CR 176). Trauma to the teeth can occur due to various reasons such as accidents or injuries, and it has been suggested that this trauma can lead to the formation of pulp stones (CR 177). However, the exact mechanism and time frame for this process is not clear.

In an attempt to analyze the direct impact of trauma on the formation of pulp stones, Subay et al. (2001) conducted a study where they applied extrusion with a force of 75g to 40 selected teeth (CR 178). They then extracted these teeth after allowing a time period of between ten and forty days to pass. However, upon checking for the formation of pulp stones, they found no evidence of such. While this may appear to downplay the possible link between trauma and the formation of pulp stones, it is important to note that the exact mechanism and time frame for this process is still not clear (CR 179).

Our study focused on examining the link between restorative treatment and the formation of pulp stones (CR 180). Restorative treatment is a common dental procedure that involves repairing or replacing damaged teeth. The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth that have undergone restorative treatment was found to be significantly higher compared to unrestored teeth, regardless of the type of tooth or arch (CR 181).

In terms of gender, our study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between males and females (CR 182). However, it is important to note that further studies may be required to examine the impact of gender on the formation of pulp stones.

Overall, our study adds to the existing body of research on the formation of pulp stones and highlights the importance of considering restorative treatment as a potential factor in their development (CR 183). Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of pulp stones and to develop effective treatment strategies.

Pulp stones are a common occurrence in dental patients, and there has been research conducted to determine the prevalence and potential causes of these calcified formations (CR 184). While gender is not typically the primary focus of this research, there have been some studies that suggest a possible correlation between gender and the prevalence of pulp stones.

Stafne & Szabo (1933) claimed that pulp stones were more commonly found in women, although they did not provide specific data to support this assertion (CR 185). Tamse et al. (1982) conducted a study that found a prevalence of pulp stones of 24.7% in women compared to 16.9% in men (CR 186). However, Baghdady et al. (1988) found almost no difference between males and females for pulp stones among a population of children aged 12 and 13 (CR 187). These results suggest that if there is indeed a variation between genders in terms of the prevalence of pulp stones, this variation may emerge over time as individuals age into adulthood.

One potential explanation for the increased prevalence of pulp stones in women could be related to their higher risk of tooth decay and need for restorative treatment (CR 188). Women may be more prone to caries due to hormonal fluctuations, dietary habits, or other factors. Additionally, women may be more likely to seek out dental care and receive restorative treatments such as fillings or crowns, which can increase the likelihood of developing pulp stones.

Another possible explanation for gender differences in the prevalence of pulp stones could be related to genetic or anatomical factors (CR 189). However, further research is needed to fully understand the causes and potential variations in the prevalence of pulp stones based on gender.

Overall, while there is some evidence to suggest that pulp stones may be more common in women than men, this relationship is not fully understood and requires further study (CR 190). Understanding the potential causes and risk factors for pulp stones can help dental professionals provide more effective treatment and preventive care to patients.

The issue of pulp stones is a significant one, and it is important to understand the factors that contribute to their development. Recent studies have shown that women are more likely to have undergone restorative treatment, with the prevalence of restorative treatment being 11% in women compared to 8% in men (CR 191). This finding is consistent with previous research, which has suggested that women are more likely to seek dental treatment than men, particularly for restorative procedures (CR 192).

There are several potential reasons why women may be more likely to seek restorative treatment for their teeth (CR 193). One possibility is that women are more attuned to their bodies and are therefore more likely to notice changes or problems with their teeth (CR 194). Additionally, women may be more likely to prioritize their dental health, particularly if they have experienced dental problems in the past (CR 195). Other factors that may contribute to the gender difference in restorative treatment include hormonal fluctuations, differences in diet, and variations in oral hygiene practices (CR 196).

One important physiological difference between men and women that may contribute to a greater vulnerability to caries is the fact that women produce less saliva than men (CR 197). Saliva plays a critical role in maintaining oral health by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria and washing away food particles and other debris from the teeth. When saliva production is reduced, the risk of dental decay increases, which may lead to the development of pulp stones (CR 198).

Despite the fact that women are more likely to undergo restorative treatment than men, the prevalence of pulp stones has not been found to be significantly higher in women (CR 199). However, this may be due to a variety of factors, including differences in the types of restorative procedures that men and women receive, variations in the severity of dental decay, and individual differences in oral health practices (CR 200).

In conclusion, while women may be more likely to seek restorative treatment for their teeth than men, the underlying causes of this gender difference are complex and multifaceted (CR 201). Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to the development of pulp stones and other dental conditions, particularly in relation to gender differences (CR 202). By gaining a better understanding of these issues, we can work towards developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies that address the unique needs of both men and women.

The impact of trauma on dental health cannot be overstated. While restoration and caries are well-known forms of dental trauma that can lead to pulp stone formation, there are other kinds of trauma that can also contribute to this issue. One such type of trauma is the kind induced by orthodontic treatment. Researchers Korkmaz, Aydın, and Sarıoğlu (2018) have found that pulp stones increase significantly in all tooth types after orthodontic treatment (CR 203). This indicates that even seemingly routine dental procedures can have an impact on the formation of pulp stones.

Another study by Chen, Huang, and Yeh (2022) looked at the correlation between pulp stones and periodontal disease (CR 204). Periodontal disease is another form of trauma or irritation that can affect dental health. The researchers found a greater prevalence of pulp stones in patients with periodontal disease overall compared to healthy individuals (CR 205). This suggests that there may be a link between various forms of dental trauma and the formation of pulp stones.

One aspect of our own research that helps to demonstrate this fundamental causative link between pulp stones and trauma is the fact that molars display by far a higher prevalence of pulp stones compared to other types of teeth (CR 206). Although molars with restorative treatment show a slightly greater prevalence of pulp stones compared to molars without restorative treatment, even this is outshined by the variation between molars and other types of teeth. This variation is itself caused by trauma. It is clear that the impact of trauma on dental health is a complex issue that requires further investigation and understanding. By exploring the various forms of trauma that can affect dental health, we can better understand the causes of pulp stone formation and work towards effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The molars, which are located at the back of the mouth, are subjected to a greater degree of wear and tear than other teeth due to their exposure to traumatic and irritating effects for a longer period of time (CR 207). This increased exposure is due to the fact that molars are typically used for chewing and grinding food, which can cause them to become worn down and damaged over time.

Furthermore, molars are more susceptible to developing cavities and decay earlier than other teeth (CR 208). This is partly because they are situated in the back of the mouth and are more difficult to clean effectively, making them more vulnerable to the accumulation of plaque and bacteria. In addition, molars experience greater occlusal pressure compared to other teeth, which can further exacerbate the impact of trauma and damage to the tooth structure.

Another possible contributing factor to the development of pulp stones in molars is the fact that they generally have a larger supply of blood flow to their pulp tissue than other teeth (CR 209). This increased blood flow can create more opportunities for the formation of blood clots, which may serve as part of the core of pulp stones in cases of trauma.

In light of these factors, it is important to take extra care when it comes to the maintenance and care of molars (CR 210). Regular dental check-ups and cleanings, as well as good oral hygiene practices such as brushing and flossing regularly, can go a long way towards preventing the development of cavities, decay, and other dental issues in these important teeth.

# **DISCUSSION**

The formation of pulp stones and calcifications in teeth is a common occurrence that has been extensively studied in dental research. However, most studies have focused on the prevalence of pulp stones in various populations without giving much attention to the factors that contribute to their formation. This has resulted in discrepancies in the reported prevalence rates, which could be attributed to a number of factors.

One of the factors that could account for the differences in prevalence rates is the variation in the sampled populations and sample sizes. For instance, studies that have sampled populations from different geographical regions or ethnic groups may report different prevalence rates due to genetic or environmental factors. Similarly, studies that have used small sample sizes may not accurately represent the true prevalence rate in a given population.

Another factor that could contribute to the discrepancies in prevalence rates is the method of assessment used in the studies. Some studies count prevalence as individuals possessing at least one pulp stone in all their teeth, while others consider the tooth specimens by themselves. This means that the percentage of overall teeth containing pulp stones, and not individuals, is counted towards the prevalence. The difference in the methods of assessment may not be disclosed in some studies, leading to confusion and discrepancies in the reported prevalence rates.

The use of radiographic methods in the detection of pulp stones is also another factor that could affect the reported prevalence rates. Radiographic methods have been found to overestimate the prevalence of pulp stones, as they may detect calcifications that are not clinically significant or may miss small pulp stones that are not visible on radiographs.

In conclusion, the prevalence of pulp stones in different populations may vary due to a range of factors, including genetic and environmental factors, sample sizes, methods of assessment, and the use of radiographic methods. Further research is needed to identify the true prevalence rate of pulp stones and to determine the factors that contribute to their formation.

In the field of dentistry, pulp stones are a relatively common occurrence, with a prevalence rate of 13.7%. This means that out of 5866 tooth specimens, 806 were found to contain pulp stones. While there is a significant amount of literature available on the subject, much of it focuses on radiographic analysis and prevalence rates in specific populations. However, very few studies have taken a comprehensive look at the potential factors that contribute to the formation of pulp stones.

It is understandable that researchers may choose to focus on specific factors and probable causes, as it is likely impossible for a single researcher or team of researchers to examine the full range of potential factors, causes, and correlations. However, it is important to consider the various factors that may contribute to the formation of pulp stones, as this can help us better understand how to prevent and treat them.

One area that has not been extensively studied is the role that restorative treatment and aging may play in the formation of pulp stones. These two factors often go hand-in-hand, as restorative treatment is often required as teeth age and become more susceptible to decay and damage. While there have been studies that have examined other potential factors, such as systemic illnesses, it is important to consider the impact of restorative treatment alongside aging.

In this study, we aim to explore the connection between restorative treatment, aging, and the formation of pulp stones. We will also consider gender as a potential factor, as there may be differences in how pulp stones form in men and women. By examining these factors in detail, we hope to gain a better understanding of the causes of pulp stones and develop more effective treatments and preventative measures.

The presence of pulp stones in teeth is a common occurrence, with 13.7% of the studied tooth specimens showing signs of this condition. However, the prevalence of pulp stones seems to be influenced by age, with individuals over the age of 40 having a higher incidence of this condition. In fact, the prevalence of pulp stones in those over the age of 40 was found to be 15.6%, while in those aged 18-40, the prevalence was 12.4%.

The reason for dividing the specimens into two age groups was due to the significance of the age of 40 years as a suitable cut-off point for both overall metabolic changes affecting teeth and for a specific potential increase in the incidence of pulp stones after this age. This was also supported by a study conducted by Udoye and Sede (2011), which analyzed various causative factors in the formation of pulp stones, with a focus on the effects of aging. They found that there was a clear increase in pulp stone prevalence between people aged under 40 years and those aged over 40 years, with the heaviest pulp stone formation occurring between the ages of 40 and 50 years.

The presence of pulp stones can be indicative of a variety of underlying dental conditions, including dental caries, dental trauma, and even systemic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. As such, the prevalence of pulp stones is an important factor to consider when assessing the overall dental health of an individual. It is also important to note that the presence of pulp stones can affect the outcome of various dental procedures, such as root canal therapy, and may require careful consideration by dental professionals.

Overall, the prevalence of pulp stones is a significant factor in dental health and warrants further investigation to fully understand its underlying causes and potential implications for dental treatment.

Caries, or tooth decay, is a common dental problem that affects many people worldwide. The condition is caused by the accumulation of bacteria on the surface of the teeth, leading to the formation of cavities. While caries can affect people of all ages, it is more prevalent in older individuals due to various factors.

Aging is a significant causative factor for the prevalence of pulp stones, which are hard, calcified structures that form within the dental pulp. Many scholars have studied the relationship between aging and pulp stones, and while there is a general consensus that pulp stones increase with age, the reasons for this phenomenon remain unclear.

One study conducted by Hill (1934) reported a high prevalence of pulp stones in various age groups. Specifically, the study found that 66% of individuals in the 10–30-year age group had pulp stones, while 80% in the 30–50-year age group and 90% in the 50–70-year age group had the condition. Although the overall prevalence percentages were higher than those found in other studies, the results indicated a significant increase in the prevalence of pulp stones with age.

However, the reasons behind this increase remain unclear, as Hill did not describe his methodology. Nevertheless, the difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between the age groups was notable. The study found a difference of 14% between the 10-to-30 and 30-to-50 age groups, and a further difference of 10% between the 30-to-50 and 50-to-70 age groups, with a slight decrease in prevalence as age increased.

While the differences in prevalence between the age groups were greater than those found in other studies, the overall trend of an increase in pulp stones with age was similar. Comparing Hill's results to those of another study, which found a difference of only 3.2% between the 18-to-40 and over-40 age groups, further supports the link between aging and pulp stones.

In conclusion, aging is a significant factor in the prevalence of pulp stones, with the condition increasing in prevalence as individuals age. The reasons behind this phenomenon remain unclear, and further research is needed to better understand the relationship between aging and pulp stones. Nevertheless, the findings of various studies indicate the need for increased dental care and monitoring for older individuals to prevent the development of pulp stones and other dental problems.

The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth has been a topic of interest for many researchers, as these stones can cause discomfort and even lead to dental problems if left untreated. In a study conducted by Hill and colleagues, they found that the prevalence of pulp stones increased with age, with a prevalence of 14.9% in the 10-to-30 age group, 44.4% in the 31-to-51 age group, and 65.1% in the over 51 age group. While the large variations in prevalence with age groups were observed, the main trend of the prevalence of pulp stones increasing with age was confirmed. This trend was also observed in our study, where we found a 3.2% difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between the 18-to-40 and the over-40 age groups.

In another study conducted by Bernick and Nedelman in 1975, they aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of aging on the pulp. They focused on degenerative processes and mechanisms caused by aging and concluded that while the pulp space decreases in general over time, conditions suitable for the gradual calcification of the pulp tissue also take place over time. However, any kind of damage or trauma has a great facilitating effect on this process, leading to the formation of pulp stones.

Overall, these studies highlight the importance of regular dental check-ups and prompt treatment of any dental problems, as the prevalence of pulp stones increases with age and can result in discomfort and dental complications if left untreated. It is also important to note that while aging is a natural process, taking care of one's dental health can help prevent or delay the onset of dental problems.

Blood clots found in the central core of pulp stones are a significant concern in the field of dentistry. The emergence of these blood clots is often attributed to damage suffered by the teeth. Damage could be caused by a range of factors such as tooth decay, trauma or injury. It is therefore essential to maintain good dental hygiene and to promptly seek dental care in case of any dental issues.

Studies have shown that the size of the pulp space and the calcification of the pulp tissue tend to diminish with age in the general population. However, the exact methodology used in these studies is not clearly explained. Bernick and Nedelman (1975) have pointed out that their tooth specimens show a clear trend in this regard. While the exact cause of this trend is not known, it is believed to be a natural part of the aging process.

Bernick's (1967) solo study suggested that the calcification process associated with aging is most apparent in the calcification of nerve tissue within the pulp. Nerve tissue calcification is a gradual process that changes with age. In younger individuals, including children between the ages of 15 and 18, small, calcified areas that are discrete and can be described as pulp stones are found in the endoneurium and perineurium. However, as individuals age, the circumferential process of calcification forms a ring around the nerve tissue. With more advanced years, the calcification process starts to take over the nerve tissue itself, and eventually, the nerve tissue ends up being completely calcified.

It is important to note that the calcification of nerve tissue within the pulp can lead to various dental issues. For instance, it can trigger the emergence of blood clots within the central core of pulp stones. Blood clots can cause intense pain and discomfort, and may even lead to the need for a root canal or tooth extraction. Therefore, it is important to maintain good dental health through regular dental check-ups and prompt treatment of any dental issues.

The formation of pulp stones has been a topic of interest for many researchers in the field of dentistry. While there is no consensus on the relationship between aging and the prevalence of pulp stones, some researchers have suggested that there is a link between the two. However, not all researchers agree with this perspective.

One study conducted by Arys et al. in 1993 analyzed 42 molars removed from children between the ages of 5 and 13. The researchers used radiographic analysis to identify the presence of pulp stones and found that 78% of the specimens had them. Based on this finding, they concluded that aging has little or nothing to do with the formation of pulp stones. While this finding is not widely accepted, it does suggest that the prevalence of pulp stones is not solely related to aging.

However, other studies have contradicted this position. For example, our study found that the 40+ age group had a greater prevalence of pulp stones than the 18-to-40 cohort. This suggests that there may be some relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones, although more research is needed to fully understand this relationship.

Another study conducted by Moss-Salentijn and Klyvert in 1983 also found a large number of pulp stones in recently erupted and healthy teeth in children aged between 11 and 15. While the researchers did not claim that aging has no bearing on the formation of pulp stones, their findings do seem to support the position of Arys et al. that the prevalence of pulp stones is not solely related to aging.

Overall, the relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones is still not fully understood. While some studies suggest that aging has little or nothing to do with the prevalence of pulp stones, other studies have found a correlation between the two. Further research is needed to fully understand this relationship and its implications for dental health.

The formation of pulp stones in teeth has been a topic of interest for many researchers. While there is a general understanding that the formation of these stones is related to aging, there is still much to be learned about the specific factors that contribute to this process. One study, conducted by Moss-Salentijn and Klyvert, found that the pulp stones they discovered in children's teeth were true pulp stones. This suggests that false pulp stones, which are more commonly found in adult teeth, had not yet formed in the children's teeth.

However, it is important to note that most studies that have examined the type of pulp stones found in adult teeth have found that the majority of them are false pulp stones. This raises questions about the relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones.

A study conducted by Arys et al. also examined the formation of pulp stones in adult teeth, but did not specify the type of pulp stones found. While it is impossible to know for certain what type of pulp stones were present in this study, it is reasonable to assume that many of them were true pulp stones.

This leads to the conclusion that the relationship between aging and the formation of pulp stones is primarily related to false pulp stones. Prolonged exposure of pulp tissue to irritation and trauma is known to facilitate the formation of these false pulp stones. True pulp stones, on the other hand, may be formed under different circumstances.

Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to the formation of both true and false pulp stones. By gaining a better understanding of these processes, we may be able to develop more effective treatments for individuals who experience issues related to pulp stones.

The importance of maintaining good oral health cannot be overstated. It is essential to visit the dentist regularly and practice good dental hygiene habits such as brushing and flossing daily. However, even with proper care, sometimes teeth may require restorative treatment. In our study, we examined the prevalence of restorative treatment in relation to gender, age, and tooth type.

Out of the 5,851 teeth examined, 551 had undergone restorative treatment, accounting for 9.4% of the sample. We found that females had a higher prevalence of restorative treatment than males, with 11% of females compared to 8% of males having undergone the treatment. In terms of age, individuals aged older than 40 years had a slightly higher prevalence of restorative treatment than those aged between 18 and 40 years.

When we looked at the different types of teeth, we found that the prevalence of restorative treatment was highest in maxillary molars and mandibular molars, with 31% and 27.3% respectively. In contrast, the prevalence of restorative treatment was lowest in mandibular incisors and mandibular canines, with only 0.5% of both types of teeth having undergone the treatment. This could be due to the fact that molars are more susceptible to decay and damage, requiring restorative treatment more often.

Interestingly, we also found a correlation between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones. Pulp stones are small, calcified structures found in the dental pulp, and can cause pain and discomfort. We found that pulp stones were most common in maxillary molars and mandibular molars, with 42% and 36% respectively. In contrast, they were least common in mandibular incisors, with only 4.6% of these teeth having pulp stones. However, there was a difference in mandibular canines, with 12.6% of these teeth having pulp stones.

Further analysis revealed that teeth with restorations had a higher prevalence of pulp stones in all tooth type categories. This suggests that there is a link between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones. It is possible that restorative treatment may weaken the tooth structure, making it more susceptible to pulp stones.

In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of maintaining good oral health to prevent the need for restorative treatment. We also found a correlation between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

The presence of pulp stones has long been a topic of interest for dental professionals. These calcified structures are found within the pulp chamber of teeth and can be indicative of a variety of dental conditions. One such condition is the need for restorative treatment, which can include procedures such as fillings, crowns, or other forms of dental repair.

In a recent study, researchers sought to explore the relationship between restorative treatment and the presence of pulp stones in various teeth. The study found that the prevalence of pulp stones varied significantly depending on the type of tooth and whether or not it had undergone restorative treatment.

For example, the study found that 3.7% of maxillary incisors without restorative treatment had pulp stones, while maxillary incisors with restorative treatment had a much higher prevalence of pulp stones at 23.9%. Similarly, mandibular incisors with restorative treatment had a prevalence of pulp stones of 20%, while only 4.5% of mandibular incisors without restorative treatment had pulp stones.

The differences in prevalence between the maxillary and mandibular incisors suggest that the relationship between restorative treatment and pulp stones may be influenced by factors such as tooth location and anatomy. Furthermore, the study found that the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary canines with restorative treatment was only slightly higher than in those without restorative treatment, while mandibular canines with restorative treatment had a much higher prevalence of pulp stones than those without restorative treatment.

The study also found significant differences in the prevalence of pulp stones in premolars and molars. While the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary premolars with restorative treatment was only slightly higher than in those without restorative treatment, mandibular premolars with restorative treatment had a much higher prevalence of pulp stones than those without restorative treatment.

Similarly, the prevalence of pulp stones in maxillary molars with restorative treatment was slightly higher than in those without restorative treatment, while mandibular molars with restorative treatment had a much higher prevalence of pulp stones than those without restorative treatment.

Overall, these findings suggest that the relationship between restorative treatment and pulp stones is complex and influenced by a variety of factors, including tooth location, anatomy, and the specific type of restoration used. Further research is needed to better understand these factors and their impact on the development of pulp stones in teeth.

The presence of pulp stones in teeth can be a cause for concern, as they can lead to various dental problems. Studies have shown that there is a correlation between restorative treatment and the prevalence of pulp stones in teeth. In the maxilla, the incidence of pulp stones in teeth with restorative treatment was found to be 28% compared to 11.2% in teeth without restorative treatment. Similarly, in the mandible, 30.1% of teeth with restorative treatment contained pulp stones, compared to 13% of teeth without restorative treatment.

There have been numerous studies conducted on the possible links between pulp stones and restorative treatment, as well as the overall impact of trauma and irritation on the health status of teeth. While most of these studies suggest that there is a correlation between caries and restorative treatment on one hand and the formation of pulp stones on the other, not all of them do so. For instance, Tamse et al. (1982) claimed that the health of the crown had no bearing on the presence of pulp stones. However, Ranjitkar et al. (2002) found a rate of 41.7% for pulp stones among teeth that were carious and had undergone restorative treatment, compared to 28.8% among healthy teeth. These results support the notion that there is a causal relationship between trauma, irritation, restoration, and pulp stones.

It is important to note that the presence of pulp stones is not always indicative of dental problems. In some cases, they may be asymptomatic and require no treatment. However, in other cases, they may cause pain, sensitivity, and inflammation, necessitating dental interventions such as root canal therapy. Therefore, it is crucial for dental professionals to be aware of the prevalence of pulp stones in teeth and to consider their potential impact on dental health when recommending restorative treatments. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between restorative treatment, trauma, irritation, and pulp stones in teeth.

Pulp stones are a common dental condition that can occur due to various reasons. These stones are formed within the pulp of teeth and can cause discomfort and pain if left untreated. The formation of pulp stones has been a topic of interest for researchers for many years, with studies attempting to identify the factors that contribute to their development.

One factor that has been extensively studied is the impact of trauma on the formation of pulp stones. Trauma to the teeth can occur due to various reasons such as accidents or injuries, and it has been suggested that this trauma can lead to the formation of pulp stones. However, the exact mechanism and time frame for this process is not clear.

In an attempt to analyze the direct impact of trauma on the formation of pulp stones, Subay et al. (2001) conducted a study where they applied extrusion with a force of 75g to 40 selected teeth. They then extracted these teeth after allowing a time period of between ten and forty days to pass. However, upon checking for the formation of pulp stones, they found no evidence of such. While this may appear to downplay the possible link between trauma and the formation of pulp stones, it is important to note that the exact mechanism and time frame for this process is still not clear.

Our study focused on examining the link between restorative treatment and the formation of pulp stones. Restorative treatment is a common dental procedure that involves repairing or replacing damaged teeth. The prevalence of pulp stones in teeth that have undergone restorative treatment was found to be significantly higher compared to unrestored teeth, regardless of the type of tooth or arch.

In terms of gender, our study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of pulp stones between males and females. However, it is important to note that further studies may be required to examine the impact of gender on the formation of pulp stones.

Overall, our study adds to the existing body of research on the formation of pulp stones and highlights the importance of considering restorative treatment as a potential factor in their development. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of pulp stones and to develop effective treatment strategies.

Pulp stones are a common occurrence in dental patients, and there has been research conducted to determine the prevalence and potential causes of these calcified formations. While gender is not typically the primary focus of this research, there have been some studies that suggest a possible correlation between gender and the prevalence of pulp stones.

Stafne & Szabo (1933) claimed that pulp stones were more commonly found in women, although they did not provide specific data to support this assertion. Tamse et al. (1982) conducted a study that found a prevalence of pulp stones of 24.7% in women compared to 16.9% in men. However, Baghdady et al. (1988) found almost no difference between males and females for pulp stones among a population of children aged 12 and 13. These results suggest that if there is indeed a variation between genders in terms of the prevalence of pulp stones, this variation may emerge over time as individuals age into adulthood.

One potential explanation for the increased prevalence of pulp stones in women could be related to their higher risk of tooth decay and need for restorative treatment. Women may be more prone to caries due to hormonal fluctuations, dietary habits, or other factors. Additionally, women may be more likely to seek out dental care and receive restorative treatments such as fillings or crowns, which can increase the likelihood of developing pulp stones.

Another possible explanation for gender differences in the prevalence of pulp stones could be related to genetic or anatomical factors. However, further research is needed to fully understand the causes and potential variations in the prevalence of pulp stones based on gender.

Overall, while there is some evidence to suggest that pulp stones may be more common in women than men, this relationship is not fully understood and requires further study. Understanding the potential causes and risk factors for pulp stones can help dental professionals provide more effective treatment and preventive care to patients.

The issue of pulp stones is a significant one, and it is important to understand the factors that contribute to their development. Recent studies have shown that women are more likely to have undergone restorative treatment, with the prevalence of restorative treatment being 11% in women compared to 8% in men. This finding is consistent with previous research, which has suggested that women are more likely to seek dental treatment than men, particularly for restorative procedures.

There are several potential reasons why women may be more likely to seek restorative treatment for their teeth. One possibility is that women are more attuned to their bodies and are therefore more likely to notice changes or problems with their teeth. Additionally, women may be more likely to prioritize their dental health, particularly if they have experienced dental problems in the past. Other factors that may contribute to the gender difference in restorative treatment include hormonal fluctuations, differences in diet, and variations in oral hygiene practices.

One important physiological difference between men and women that may contribute to a greater vulnerability to caries is the fact that women produce less saliva than men. Saliva plays a critical role in maintaining oral health by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria and washing away food particles and other debris from the teeth. When saliva production is reduced, the risk of dental decay increases, which may lead to the development of pulp stones.

Despite the fact that women are more likely to undergo restorative treatment than men, the prevalence of pulp stones has not been found to be significantly higher in women. However, this may be due to a variety of factors, including differences in the types of restorative procedures that men and women receive, variations in the severity of dental decay, and individual differences in oral health practices.

In conclusion, while women may be more likely to seek restorative treatment for their teeth than men, the underlying causes of this gender difference are complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that contribute to the development of pulp stones and other dental conditions, particularly in relation to gender differences. By gaining a better understanding of these issues, we can work towards developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies that address the unique needs of both men and women.

The impact of trauma on dental health cannot be overstated. While restoration and caries are well-known forms of dental trauma that can lead to pulp stone formation, there are other kinds of trauma that can also contribute to this issue. One such type of trauma is the kind induced by orthodontic treatment. Researchers Korkmaz, Aydın, and Sarıoğlu (2018) have found that pulp stones increase significantly in all tooth types after orthodontic treatment. This indicates that even seemingly routine dental procedures can have an impact on the formation of pulp stones.

Another study by Chen, Huang, and Yeh (2022) looked at the correlation between pulp stones and periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is another form of trauma or irritation that can affect dental health. The researchers found a greater prevalence of pulp stones in patients with periodontal disease overall compared to healthy individuals. This suggests that there may be a link between various forms of dental trauma and the formation of pulp stones.

One aspect of our own research that helps to demonstrate this fundamental causative link between pulp stones and trauma is the fact that molars display by far a higher prevalence of pulp stones compared to other types of teeth. Although molars with restorative treatment show a slightly greater prevalence of pulp stones compared to molars without restorative treatment, even this is outshined by the variation between molars and other types of teeth. This variation is itself caused by trauma. It is clear that the impact of trauma on dental health is a complex issue that requires further investigation and understanding. By exploring the various forms of trauma that can affect dental health, we can better understand the causes of pulp stone formation and work towards effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The molars, which are located at the back of the mouth, are subjected to a greater degree of wear and tear than other teeth due to their exposure to traumatic and irritating effects for a longer period of time. This increased exposure is due to the fact that molars are typically used for chewing and grinding food, which can cause them to become worn down and damaged over time.

Furthermore, molars are more susceptible to developing cavities and decay earlier than other teeth. This is partly because they are situated in the back of the mouth and are more difficult to clean effectively, making them more vulnerable to the accumulation of plaque and bacteria. In addition, molars experience greater occlusal pressure compared to other teeth, which can further exacerbate the impact of trauma and damage to the tooth structure.

Another possible contributing factor to the development of pulp stones in molars is the fact that they generally have a larger supply of blood flow to their pulp tissue than other teeth. This increased blood flow can create more opportunities for the formation of blood clots, which may serve as part of the core of pulp stones in cases of trauma.

In light of these factors, it is important to take extra care when it comes to the maintenance and care of molars. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings, as well as good oral hygiene practices such as brushing and flossing regularly, can go a long way towards preventing the development of cavities, decay, and other dental issues in these important teeth.

# **CONCLUSION**

The dental industry has long been fascinated with the formation of pulp stones, and this study aimed to shed light on the potential link between prior restorative treatment and the development of these structures within the tooth (CR 211). Our hypothesis was that previous dental work could be a causative factor for the formation of pulp stones, and we set out to investigate this theory in more detail.

As we delved deeper into our research, we also wanted to examine the possible correlations between pulp stones and age and gender. Although some studies have suggested that there may be gender differences in the prevalence of pulp stones, the evidence for this is not entirely conclusive (CR 212). We found that there was no statistically significant variation between males and females in terms of pulp stones, but interestingly, women were more likely to have undergone restorative treatment than men.

When it came to age, however, our findings were much more conclusive (CR 213). The literature on pulp stone formation is largely in agreement that advancing age is a significant factor in the development of these structures, and our research supported this conclusion. We found that older individuals were more likely to have pulp stones than younger individuals, providing further evidence for the link between age and this dental phenomenon.

Overall, our study contributes to our understanding of the factors that contribute to the formation of pulp stones (CR 214). While we did not find conclusive evidence that prior restorative treatment is a direct cause of this condition, we did find that aging plays a significant role. As the population continues to age, it is important for dental professionals to be aware of the increased risk of pulp stones in older individuals and to take steps to prevent and treat this condition.

Pulp stones are small, calcified structures that can develop within the pulp chamber of teeth, and they have been the subject of much debate and discussion in the dental community (CR 215). While there is a general consensus that pulp stones can have negative effects on tooth health and function, there is still much to be learned about their causes and mechanisms of formation.

One area of controversy in this field has been the role of aging in the development of pulp stones (CR 216). While some researchers have suggested that aging is a primary factor in pulp stone formation, this study challenges that assumption, arguing that age is actually a secondary effect of trauma.

According to this study, trauma is the primary cause behind the formation of pulp stones, playing a vital role in the development of false pulp stones, which make up the majority of all pulp stones (CR 217). Trauma can come in many forms, including physical injury, infection, or even the normal wear and tear that comes with everyday use of the teeth.

As time passes, teeth are naturally exposed to greater amounts of trauma and irritation, which can lead to the formation of pulp stones (CR 218). This is where age comes into play – as teeth are exposed to more trauma over time, they become more prone to developing pulp stones. However, age is not a direct cause of pulp stone formation; rather, it is a secondary effect of ongoing trauma.

Another factor that can contribute to the formation of pulp stones is restorative treatment (CR 219). While the precise mechanism for this is not entirely clear, it is believed that restorative procedures can be traumatic for the teeth, which in turn can kickstart or facilitate pulp stone formation over time.

Overall, the formation of pulp stones is a complex process that involves a variety of factors, including trauma, age, and restorative treatment (CR 220). By understanding these factors and their roles in pulp stone formation, dentists and researchers can work to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies for this common dental condition.

The presence of pulp stones in our research findings is not unexpected, given the anatomical and physiological characteristics of molars (CR 221). Molars are the teeth that emerge earlier than other teeth, and they are subject to greater occlusal pressure due to their location in the back of the mouth. Moreover, molars are more susceptible to caries due to the comparatively higher difficulty in brushing and cleaning them. Over time, these factors contribute to a longer and greater exposure to trauma and irritation, which supports our conclusions about the formation of pulp stones.

Although trauma is undoubtedly a significant factor in the development of pulp stones, it is important to recognize that other factors may also play a role (CR 222). For instance, existing literature suggests that systemic illnesses may contribute to the formation of pulp stones. Our study could be expanded to incorporate more detailed health status information about patients, which could help to identify potential connections between systemic illnesses and the occurrence of pulp stones.

Despite the potential for further research in this area, we believe that our study has made a noteworthy contribution to the understanding of pulp stones (CR 223). By identifying the factors that contribute to their formation, we can develop more effective strategies for preventing and treating this condition. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of good oral hygiene practices, particularly with regard to the cleaning of molars, which can help to reduce the risk of developing pulp stones over time. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay of factors that contribute to the development of dental conditions and the importance of ongoing research to advance our understanding of these issues.
