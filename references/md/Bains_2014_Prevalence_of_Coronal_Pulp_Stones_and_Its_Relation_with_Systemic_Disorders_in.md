*Aim.* To estimate the prevalence of coronal pulp stones in the molar teeth of dental outpatients of Sunam, Sangrur district, Punjab, India, to report any association between occurrence of pulp stones with age, gender, dental arch, side, and dental status and to find out correlation between pulp stones with dental and systemic diseases.
 *Materials and Methods.* 500 routine dental outpatients within age group of 18-67 years were involved in the study. Molar bitewing of left and right side of each patient was taken with XCP bitewing instrument and size 2 film. The presence or absence of pulp stones was recorded. Chi-square analysis was used to record the prevalence of pulp stones and to compare it with demographic and systemic factors.
 *Results.* Overall prevalence of pulp stones was 41.8%. Pulp stones were significantly higher in maxilla (11.59%) than mandible (6.54%), left side than right side, and first molar than other molars. Higher numbers of pulp stones were recorded in patients with cardiovascular disease (38.89%) than with cholelithiasis and renal lithiasis.
 *Conclusion.* Pulp stones were higher in maxillary arch than mandibular arch and in females than males. Cardiovascular patients had higher number of pulp stones than other groups.

 (Table 3). The prevalence of pulp stones in attrited teeth was (male = 12.19%, female = 26.22%) 18.18% (Tables 4 and 5).
The prevalence of pulp stones in periodontal pathol­ogy teeth (male = 15.78%, female = 17.20%) was 16.41%. The prevalence of pulp stones in carious teeth (male = 5.22% female = 7.32%) was 6.23%. The prevalence of pulp stones in restored teeth (male = 13.55%, female = 10.96%) was 12.34% (Tables 4 and 5).
The prevalence of pulp stones in orthodontically treated patients (male = 6.25%, female = 7.14%) was 6.66% (Table 6). The prevalence of pulp stones in arteriosclerotic (male = 50%, female = 25%) patients was 38.88%. The prevalence of pulp stones in renal stone (male = 20% and female = 14.2%) patients was 16.66%. The prevalence of pulp stones in cholelithiasis (male = 0% and female = 25%) patients was 10% (Table 7).
4. Discussion
The present study comprised of 500 patients, 243 females and 257 males within age group of 18-67 years. Molar bitewing radiographs of right and left side of each patient were taken and evaluated by maxillofacial radiologist for presence of pulp stones.
The prevalence of pulp stone calculated in this study was 41.8% and females exhibited higher pulp stones than male and maxillary teeth had higher pulp stones than mandibular teeth which are in accordance with other studies conducted by Ranjitkar et al. \[1\], Tamse et al. \[10\], and Goga et al. \[11\]. The prevalence of pulp stones in this study was found to be higher in the first molar than in the second molar which is in agreement with other investigators \[1, 10, 12\]. A plausible explanation is that the early eruption of the first molar will expose them for long period of time, to more degenerative changes, thus confirming that the calcification of the pulp increases with the time \[13\]. Al-Nazhan and Al-Shamrani \[13\] concluded that most attributable reason could be that as age advances the structure of the normal pulp varies. This usually leads to a progressive decrease in the number of pulp cells as well as gradual increase in mucopolysaccharides and fibrous elements leading to calcification. In the present study, 58-67 years group showed higher pulp stones which was in harmony with
Sayegh and Reed study \[14\].
Our study showed that 16.41% teeth with pulp stones were associated with periodontal pathology. Reports dealing with the effect of periodontal disease on the pulp tissue showed a close relationship between the presence of pulp calcifications and periodontal disease. Sheykhrezaee et al. concluded that periodontal disease can lead to fibrosis and calcification \[15\]. Sübay et al. examined sixty teeth with various degrees of periodontal disease and found pulp calcification in 78% of teeth and suggested that periodontal disease interferes with blood supply and nutrition of the pulp causing decrease in cellular elements and increase in calcification \[16\].
The present study revealed that out of 143 attrited teeth, 26 teeth showed pulp stones which were less than reported by Al-Nazhan and
Al-Shamrani \[13\]. Studies have shown that irritants like attrition and caries can lead to deleterious influence on the pulp \[9\]. Spouge reported that the physical abrasiveness of the diet and the highly developed muscles of mastication account in part for the high rate of attrition. Irritation in form of attrition causes circulatory disturbances and thrombosis which mineralizes leading to pulp stone formation \[13\].
Carious lesions stimulate inflammatory changes within pulp leading to secondary dentin formation and increased calcification \[5\]. The recent literature suggests that pulp stones are a feature of an irritated pulp, an attempt to repair itself \[1\]. In our investigation we observed that out of 481 carious teeth, 30 (6.2%) teeth showed pulp stones. However, prevalence was low as noticed by Al-Nazhan and Al-Shamrani \[13\]. It is known that trauma in the form of restorative procedure can cause capillary thrombosis and/or vascular wall damage which on mineralization can lead to formation of pulp stone. In this study, out of 332 restored teeth, 41 (12.3%) teeth had pulp stones. This was in accordance to
Al-Nazhan and Al-Shamrani.
Sayegh and Reed \[14\] concluded that systemic variations such as arteriosclerosis and renal lithiasis can be considered as factors predisposing to pulpal calcification which was later confirmed by Moura and Paiva in his radiographic study.

Edds et al. found a significant (75%) relationship between preexisting cardiovascular disease and pulp stones. In our study, out of 18 arteriosclerotic patients, 7 (38.8%) had pulp stones which is less than that reported by Edds et al. \[9\].
Out of 12 renal stone patients, 2 (16.67%) had pulp stones and out of 10 cholelithiasis patients 1 had pulp stone (10%). Stafne and Szabo \[17\] suggested that pulp stones are not directly responsible for the production of renal stones and gall stones. However, Çiftçiouglu et al.
proposed that nanobacteria may induce pulp calcification and kidney stone and gall stone formation \[4\].
So, we suggest that patients with pulp stones have high propensity to develop cardiovascular or cholelithiasis. So, such patients should be screened to asses such complications at early stages. Orthodontic force application may produce periodontal inflammatory reaction. Forces can cause odon­toblastic layer degeneration due to circulatory disturbances in human pulp tissue causing calcification. The present study showed that two patients (6.66%) had pulp stones out of 30 orthodontically treated patients. Delivanis found 2 patients (4.34%) having pulp calcification out of 46 orthodontic treated patients. Sübay et al.
\[16\] found 17.5% pulp stones in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. They concluded in their study that extrusive forces applied to teeth do not cause significant pathological changes in human pulp tissue.
5. Conclusion
Considering the fact that this is the first study in Punjabi population that may provide a preliminary data regarding the usefulness of bite wing radiography for coronal pulp stone estimation and their implication in endodontic treatment and its relationship with pain, this study may be used as a rapid screening method for early identification of potential cardiovascular diseases. It may serve as an adjunct in forensic odontology. However, large scale longitudinal studies are required to substantiate the findings obtained in this study.
