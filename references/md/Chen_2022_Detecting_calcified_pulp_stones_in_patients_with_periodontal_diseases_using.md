## **Introduction**


Pulpal calcified structures are fairly common. Such calcifi­cation of dental pulp tissue, often known as denticle,
pulp stone, or dystrophic calcification, has been studied for over a decade. Pulp stones may occur in any one or multiple teeth, deciduous or permanent, healthy or disease, and even in unerupted or impacted teeth. Pulp stone calci­fications vary in number from one or more in a single tooth or in multiple teeth. Their size varies from minute particles to large calcified mass, occluding a part or the entire pulp cavity. Pulp stones are more often seen in coronal pulp although they are also found in radicular areas. These calcifications and/or stones are usually asymptomatic, except when impinging on the nerve or blood vessel. (see Figs. 1 and 2)
Despite a number of microscopic and histochemical studies, the exact causes of pulp calcification remains largely unclear., A host of factors like age, dental trauma, periodontal disease, orthodontic treatment and systemic disease are implicated., The prevalence of pulp stones ranges from 8% to 90%.,, The detection of pulpal calcifications in human dental pulp, based on radiographic examinations, has been reported to be 2.1%---63.6% across different populations., The occurrence of pulp calcifi­cations are generally believed to be under-estimated. That is mainly because small calcified masses (\<200 urn) are not easily detected with radiographic imaging. The current digital imaging systems, including periapical, panoramic and cone-beam computed tomography radiography can provide more realistic and accurate images. Hence, visualizing the orientation and dimensions of pulpal struc­tures can be better in replicating and measuring the pulp stone calcifications. However, no such related investigation has been reported regarding two commonly used clinical radiographic techniques on diagnosing pulp tissue disease and occurrence of pulp stone calcifications.
The purpose of this study was: (a) to compare two commonly used digital radiographic techniques, i.e., panoramic and periapical radiograhy, in detecting pulp stone calcifications at dental pulps of patients with peri­odontal diseases; (b) to determine the association between

the occurrence of pulpal calcifications and related factors like age, gender, tooth type and dental arch sextant.
Materials and methods **Patient selection**
Our study protocol was approved by the Institutional Re­view Board of
Research Ethics Committee of Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, and complied with guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki. We retrospectively reviewed and evaluated the radiological records of a total of 465 patients (271 male, 194 female), including 12,407 teeth (7229 male, 5178 female). Patients all received full mouth periodontal treatment under the diagnosis of chronic generalized periodontitis, requiring radiographic examination as part of their oral examination and treat­ment modality. Periodontal treatment was covered by the
Government's Periodontal Health Care Program. Images were taken with digital panoramic radiography (DPR) and full mouth periapical radiography (PAR) (including 12 peri­apical and 4 bitewing images).
Procedures were taken at the Outpatient Clinics of the Department of
Stomatology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital between January and
December of 2020, before the treatment planning setting. Patients were divided into various groups according to their age, gender and tooth locations. Patients aged between 17 and 99 years old.
**Image taking and data record**
Radiographic examinations were taken using a digital radiograhy system (Sirona, Orthophos XG, Bensheim, 1) showed more than one pulpal radiopacities or calcifications
Germany) under the manufacturer's recommended expo­sure settings (8 MA, 69Kvp and 14 s). X-ray images were displayed directly on a 4G monitor at a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Images measurements were performed with the manufacturer's software (EBM dental, Taichung, Taiwan). Image contrast and brightness were adjusted using the image-processing tool for optimal visualization. Teeth were scored as having a pulp stone when a definitive radi­opaque mass had been observed in the pulp space. The pulp stone was evaluated and identified from both the DPR and PAR images, and confirmed by a senior dental radiologist and two endodontists of our hospital. Intra- or inter­observer variability was determined at the level of \<5%.
**Statistical analyses**
Data were analyzed using the standard statistical software (IBM SPSS version 22.0, New York, USA). Bivariate associa­tions between genders and comparisons of the DPR and the PAR imaging modalities in terms of pulp stone identifica­tions were evaluated using Pearson's Chi-square test.
McNemar correlations test was used to determine the relationship with age, tooth location and dental arches sextants. All statistical analyse were done using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) with a significance P level set at \<0.05.
Results
A total of 465 patients (194 females, 271 males) were included in this one year retrospective study. Their mean of age was 48.2 ± 17.7 years (ranged from 17 to 99 years). The tooth missing rate was 16.5% (1030/6208) for females,\ and 16.6% (1443/8672) for males (Table 1). Pulp cavity radiopacities were detected in 270 (58.0%) subjects on DPR images and 348 (74.8%) subjects on DPA images in 1 or more teeth, which included 110 (23.6%) in female and 160 (34.4%) in male on DPR images, and 146 (31.3%) in female and 202 (43.4%) in male on DPA images. Of individual teeth, the occurrence of pulp stone calcifications was observed 1031 teeth on the
DPR images, and 1326 teeth on the DPA images (Table 1). In those DPR images, 56 patients (20.7%) had only one tooth with pulp chamber calcifica­tion, while 207 patients (76.6%) had pulp stone in more than one tooth, and 7 (2.5%) patients had more than 10 teeth. In the DPA images, 64 patients (18.3%) had only one tooth with pulp chamber calcification, while 274 patients (78.7%) had more than one tooth and 10 patients (2.8%) had more than 10 teeth with pulp chamber calcification.
Regarding the location and root number of teeth, pulp stones in one, two and three root teeth were found respectively in 11.44% (118/1031), 23.37% (241/1031) and 65.17% (672/1031) on DPR images. From observation of DPA images, pulp stones in one, two, three root teeth were identified respectively in 22.47% (298/1326), 33.1% (439/1326), and 44.41% (589/1326) of images (Table 1). Comparisons of pulp stones between genders and across ages and/or canals were shown in Table 1. The detection of pulp stones was not significantly different across gen­ders nor for age groups of \<20 and of 21---40 years. More prevalent and obviously pulp stones were identified in the age groups of 41-60 years, and of \>60 years (Table 1). Table 2 summarizes the distribution of teeth with or without pulp stones formation according to tooth location, type of tooth and dental arch sextants. The prevalence of pulp stones in the maxillary and mandibular arches was about equal in DPA images, but found more often in the DPR images at the maxillary area. So forth, pulp stones were more prevalent in the maxillary arch (10.4%) than in the mandibular arch (6.1%) in DPR images, with a signifi­cant difference between arches (Table 2). Moreover, calcified mass in the right and left side were equally observed. Calcify pulp stones were clearly observed in the maxillary molar region, and also more often with old ages especially in periodontally involved teeth. Finally, the occurrence of pulp stones was the highest at the maxillary first molar (22.1% in DPR vs 28.7% in
DPA), followed by the maxillary second molar (24.9% in DPR vs 19.6% in
DPA), and mandibular first molar (15.6% in DPR vs 17.2% in DPA) (P \< 0.05). The mandibular incisors were the least affected teeth (0.3% in
DPR vs 2.4% in DPA) (Table 2). Overall, 8.3% (1031/12407) of teeth had pulp stones as examined by DPR examination, whereas 10.6% of the teeth (1326/12407) had a pulp stone easily detected in DPA im­ages. We suggested that digital periapical radiography examinations are a great opportunity to observe and identify pulpal calcification prior aggressive dental pro­cedures to be scheduled (Table 1).

## **Discussion**


Pulpal calcifications occur widely in dental pulps of healthy or diseased humans, and even in un-erupted or impacted Table 1 Distribution of examined teeth with pulp stone calcification by patients characteristics.

 teeth. Calcified masses in the pulps have been studied for many years. The consensus is the occurrence of such calcification mostly is due to dystrophy or degeneration of dental pulp tissues. Therefore, dystrophic calcification is a physiological and/or pathological manifestation. The occurrence of pulp stones is known to be related to func­tional disturbance due to aging, tooth trauma, periodontal disease, pathologic changes in enamel or dentin structures, and systemic diseases such coronary artery disease, dia­betes mellitus and renal dysfunction.
The prevalence of pulpal calcification varies from 8% to 90%. The variations may be due to differences in measuring tools and study populations. It is also believed that calcifications with diameter \<200 urn are not readily identifiable on radiographic images. Based on radio­graphic examinations in the past 20 years the occurrence of pulp stones are reported to be 2.1%---63.6% in different populations and geographical locations: e.g.
Hamasha et al. on Jordanian; Gulsahi et al. and Turkal et al. on
Turkish; Al-Ghurabi & Najm on Iraqi; Kannan et al. on Malaysian; Kumar et al. and Sandhu et al. on Indian; Jayam et al. on Nepalese;
Hassanabadi et al. and Kuzekanani et al. on Iranian; Kalaji et al. on
Yemini; Sadoon et al. on Saudi Arabia and Alawjaki on Libyan (Table 3). Digital panoramic radiography and periapical radiography are currently the most widely used clinical tools in intraoral examinations.
They are typically used to calibrate the bony defect and abnormal radioluceny and radiopacity shadow in the oral cavity. Newly developed
CBCT provides a reliable visualization of the orientation and dimensions of oral structures. But digital panoramic and periapical radiography can provide realistic images allowing different angulations and the ease in replicating measurements. Results of our present study comply with previous reports utilizing DPR and DPA images to identify and characterize pulp cavity opacities.
The prevalence of pulp stone calcifications we found in this present study is 58% of personal subjects (270/465) in DPR images and 74.8% (348/465) in DPA images. Such findings are similar to those reported earlier by Colak et al. (2012) Sisman et al. (2012) Kumar et al.
(2015) and SriVarsh (2019). Regarding individual teeth we found the occurrence of pulpal radiopacities being 8.3% (1031/12047) in DPR images and 10.6% (1326/12407) in DPA images. This finding is also similar with those re­ports by Ranjitkar et al. (2002)
AlNazhan & Sl-Shamrani (2011) Jayam et al. (2017) Kuzekanani et al.
(2018). The findings supported a significant dif­ference between two assessed radiographic techniques (Table 1) (P \< 0.01).
Robertson et al. in 1997 and Holan in 1998 analyzed the incidence of calcific metamorphosis using radiographic techniques and they found a significant correlation be­tween calcification and dental trauma. Other re­searchers reported the incidence of calcified bodies in the dental pulp increased with age. Our results are in line with their findings. In our study population including four age groups (from 17 to \>60 years of age) and results indi­cated the occurrence of pulp stone calcifications in the dental pulps of periodontal disease increased with old age
Journal of Dental Sciences 17 (2022) 965-972 groups, particularly those aged \>40 years (Table 1). Over 90.6% (935/1031) in DPR images, and 89.7% (1192/1326) in DPA images had pulp stone calcifications identified in those older age groups (p \< 0.001).
Studies of Hillmann & Geurtsen (1997), Fetami et al. (2012) and Chen &
Huang (2016) reported higher rate pulpal calcifications in elderly patients with periodontal disease. These authors also suggested that the frequency, duration and intensity of chronic irritations being causative factors for such calcifi­cations. Consistent with that, we found a high incidence of pulp stone calcifications in periodontally involved teeth up to 58.0%---78.8% respectively (p \< 0.006).
In this study, we found no correlation between gender and pulp cavity calcification (p \ 0.05). Our finding is in line with the work of
Sayegh & Reed (1968) and Stroner & Van Cura (1984). Furthermore, the tendency we found for a higher chance of pulp calcifications in molar teeth also agrees with the most recent studies. We confirmed the higher prevalence of calcifications in molar teeth (65.1% in DPA and 44.1% in
DPA) compared with bicuspid (23.3% in DPA and 33.1% in DPA) and incisors (11.4% in DPR and 22.4% in DPA) (Table 1). The underlying casuse may be related to their large pulp chamber and space in the dentition, and hence greater chance to be injured and damaged during daily mastication, leading to formation of calcified stones.
In conclusion, our results are in support of pulpal cal­cifications commonly occurring in human dental pulp tis­sue. Other findings are the prevalence of pulp stone calcifications in a group of periodontal patients in Taiwan
Chinese population was 58.0% with digital panoramic ex­amination, and 74.8% with digital periapical radiographic examination. Both prevalence rates were higher than other populations such as Libyan (Alawjali 2019),
Indian (Yousuf et al., 2018; Sandhu et al., 2018), Iranian (Has- sanabadi et al., 2018; Kuzekanani et al., 2018), Nepal (Jayam et al., 2017), Turkish (Turkal et al., 2013; Gulsahi et al., 2009), Saudi Arabia (AlNazhan & STShamrani 2011;
Sadoon et al., 2019), and Iraqi (Al-Ghurabi & Najm (2012) tions are likely dystrophic and degenerative manifesta­tions, and may develop in different patterns and number and/or size due to chronic local irritation such as aging, periodontal disease, and dental trauma. In addition, we found pulpal calcifications in maxillary molar teeth being more common than in bicuspids and incisors (Table 1). Our findings of incidence of pulp calcification associated with chronic tissue inflammation (e.g., periodontal disease) which likely plays a key role in the formation of pulpal calcification. Since conflicting reports in the literature exist regarding the association between pulp calcification and systemic disturbances. Further studies on longitudinal data of larger samples would help to clarify potential correlation between systemic and medical disorders such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and renal dysfunction.
